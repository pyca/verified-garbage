//! Wycheproof (<https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof>) tests.
//!
//! The vectors are read from the checkout named by `WYCHEPROOF_ROOT`; if it
//! is not set, the tests are skipped (CI always sets it).
//!
//! Every algorithm gets a module here that loads its test vector files with
//! [`harness::load`] and checks each vector against the crate's public API.
//! A `valid` vector must produce exactly the expected result, an `invalid`
//! one must be rejected, and for an `acceptable` one either outcome is fine
//! (but a result, if produced, must be the expected one).
