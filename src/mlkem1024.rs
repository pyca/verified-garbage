//! ML-KEM-1024 (FIPS 203), the module-lattice-based key-encapsulation
//! mechanism, at security category 5.
//!
//! Key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation are the verified
//! assembly functions `vg_mlkem1024_keygen`, `vg_mlkem1024_encaps` and
//! `vg_mlkem1024_decaps` (contracts `VG.Spec.MlKem1024.keyGenContract`,
//! `encapsContract` and `decapsContract`): FIPS 203's internal algorithms
//! `ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal`, `ML-KEM.Encaps_internal` and
//! `ML-KEM.Decaps_internal` (§6), which compose the verified polynomial
//! arithmetic and SHA-3. The encapsulation key check of §7.2 is
//! `vg_mlkem1024_check_ek`. This module supplies their randomness and
//! working space, and destroys the intermediate values (§3.3).
//!
//! A decapsulation key is kept as the 64-byte seed `d ‖ z` it is generated
//! from (§3.3), which [`DecapsulationKey1024::from_seed`] expands; the caller
//! generates the seed with an approved RBG. The expanded decapsulation key is
//! never exposed, so the decapsulation keys this module uses pass the checks
//! of §7.3 by construction. An encapsulation key from elsewhere passes the
//! check of §7.2 in [`EncapsulationKey1024::from_bytes`].
//!
//! The bound on `SampleNTT`'s loop (280 iterations, as Appendix B allows) is
//! reached with probability less than 2⁻²⁶¹ for each call; key generation,
//! encapsulation and decapsulation each call it 16 times (once for each
//! entry of the matrix `Â`), so an operation reaches it with probability
//! less than 2⁻²⁵⁷, and then fails with [`Error::SampleBound`].
//!
//! On x86-64, key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation have an
//! instance for each implementation of `vg_mlkem_sample_ntt4`, which samples
//! four entries of the matrix at once, and each operation calls the best one
//! the CPU can run.
