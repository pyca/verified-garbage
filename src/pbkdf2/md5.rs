//! `vg_pbkdf2_hmac_md5` (contract `VG.Spec.Hmac.Instance.pbkdf2Contract` of
//! `VG.Spec.Hmac.md5I`). On x86-64 and AArch64, it is the one PBKDF2
//! implementation for every Merkle–Damgård hash function, calling MD5's verified functions: its
//! iteration calls MD5's verified compression function directly, twice per
//! step.
//!
//! On ARMv7 and x86, the whole derivation is the one for every streaming hash
//! function, calling MD5's verified streaming functions, HMAC-MD5's
//! `init` and `finalize` and `vg_pbkdf2_hmac_md5_iterate` (contract
//! `VG.Spec.Hmac.Instance.iterateContract`), the one PBKDF2 iteration for
//! every streaming hash function.
