//! PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-384. The whole derivation is
//! `vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha384` (contract `VG.Spec.Hmac.Instance.pbkdf2Contract` of
//! `VG.Spec.Hmac.sha384I`). On x86-64 and AArch64, it is the one PBKDF2
//! implementation for every Merkle–Damgård hash function, calling SHA-384's verified functions: its
//! iteration calls SHA-512's verified compression function directly, twice per
//! step. On x86-64, it follows the implementation of SHA-512 compression that
//! `Sha384` runs on this CPU (`vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha384_shani`,
//! `vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha384_avx2`: the same verified code calling
//! `vg_sha512_compress_<suffix>`, with the same contract).
//!
//! On ARMv7 and x86, the whole derivation is the one for every streaming hash
//! function, calling SHA-384's verified streaming functions, HMAC-SHA-384's
//! `init` and `finalize` and `vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha384_iterate` (contract
//! `VG.Spec.Hmac.Instance.iterateContract`), the one PBKDF2 iteration for
//! every streaming hash function.
//!
//! On AArch64, the `_sha3` variants follow SHA-512 hardware dispatch.
