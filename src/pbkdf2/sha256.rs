//! PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256 (RFC 8018 §5.2).
//!
//! The whole derivation is `vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256` (contract
//! `VG.Spec.Hmac.Instance.pbkdf2Contract` of `VG.Spec.Hmac.sha256I`). On x86-64
//! and AArch64, it is the one PBKDF2 implementation for every Merkle–Damgård
//! hash function, calling SHA-256's verified functions. On x86-64 and x86, it
//! follows the implementation of SHA-256 that `Sha256` runs on this CPU:
//! `vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_shani` with the SHA extensions, the same verified
//! code calling `vg_sha256_compress_shani` (and, on x86, the SHA-NI streaming,
//! HMAC and iteration functions), with the same contract; likewise, on x86-64,
//! `vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_avx2` with AVX2. AArch64 selects
//! `vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_sha2` when the SHA-256 instructions are available.
//!
//! On ARMv7 and x86, the whole derivation is the one for every streaming hash
//! function, calling SHA-256's verified streaming functions, HMAC-SHA-256's
//! `init` and `finalize` and `vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_iterate` (contract
//! `VG.Spec.Hmac.Instance.iterateContract`), the one PBKDF2 iteration for
//! every Merkle–Damgård hash function: each step is two calls of SHA-256's
//! verified compression function.
