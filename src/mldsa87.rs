//! ML-DSA-87 (FIPS 204), the module-lattice-based digital signature
//! algorithm, at security category 5.
//!
//! Key generation is the verified assembly function `vg_mldsa87_keygen`
//! (contract `VG.Spec.MlDsa.keyGenContract` for `mlDsa87`),
//! `ML-DSA.KeyGen_internal` (FIPS 204 Algorithm 6); signing and verification
//! are `vg_mldsa87_sign_message` and `vg_mldsa87_verify_message`
//! (`signMessageContract` and `verifyMessageContract`), `ML-DSA.Sign` and
//! `ML-DSA.Verify` (Algorithms 2 and 3), which format the message with its
//! context string, compute the message representative `μ` and call the
//! internal algorithms on it, `vg_mldsa87_sign` and `vg_mldsa87_verify`
//! (§6), all composing the verified polynomial arithmetic and SHA-3. This
//! module supplies the randomness and working space, and destroys the
//! intermediate values (§3.6.3).
//!
//! A private key is kept as the 32-byte seed `ξ` it is generated from
//! (§3.6.3), which [`SigningKey87::from_seed`] expands; the caller generates
//! the seed with an approved RBG. The expanded private key is never
//! exposed. HashML-DSA (§5.4) is not provided.
//!
//! The loops FIPS 204 lets an implementation bound (Appendix C) reach their
//! bounds with probability about 2⁻²⁵⁶ or less; the operation then fails
//! with [`Error::LoopBound`].
