//! AES-GCM (NIST SP 800-38D) with 128-, 192- and 256-bit AES keys.
//!
//! The whole AEAD is verified assembly: `vg_aes_gcm_init` (contract
//! `VG.Spec.Gcm.initContract`) writes the key context (the AES key schedule
//! and the hash subkey `H`), `vg_aes_gcm_seal` and `vg_aes_gcm_open`
//! (`sealContract`, `openContract`) are GCM-AE and GCM-AD (§7), and
//! `vg_aes_gcm_stream_init`, `_aad`, `_encrypt`, `_decrypt`, `_finish` and
//! `_verify` keep a streaming state (`VG.Spec.Gcm.StreamRepr`). `open` and
//! `verify` check the tag, in constant time, and `open` decrypts only if it
//! matches. This module checks the lengths of §5.2.1.1, which the assembly
//! does not, and holds the key context and the state.
//!
//! An [`AesGcm`] is a key: it encrypts and decrypts whole messages at once,
//! and starts incremental ones with [`AesGcm::encryptor`] and
//! [`AesGcm::decryptor`], which borrow it. **An [`AesGcmDecryptor`]'s
//! `update` returns plaintext that has not been authenticated yet**: nothing
//! may act on it before its `finalize` has succeeded. When the whole message
//! fits in memory, [`AesGcm::decrypt_in_place`] checks the tag before it
//! decrypts.
//!
//! # Tags
//!
//! Encryption returns the full 16-byte tag; a protocol that sends a shorter
//! one sends its first bytes. Decryption takes a `&[u8; 16]`
//! ([`AesGcm::decrypt_in_place`], [`AesGcmDecryptor::finalize`]), or, for a
//! protocol that truncates the tag, a `&[u8; N]` whose length `N` is a type
//! parameter ([`AesGcm::decrypt_in_place_truncated`],
//! [`AesGcmDecryptor::finalize_truncated`]): one of the lengths SP 800-38D
//! §5.2.1.2 allows, 4, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16 bytes, checked at compile
//! time. The length is never taken from a slice, because a slice's length
//! often comes from the message: a protocol that splits a message with
//! `msg.split_at(msg.len().saturating_sub(16))` would, given a 4-byte
//! message, check an empty ciphertext against a 4-byte tag, which an
//! attacker forges with probability 2⁻³² instead of 2⁻¹²⁸. Tags of 4 and 8
//! bytes are only for the applications of SP 800-38D Appendix C, which
//! bounds the lengths of the messages and the number of decryptions under
//! one key.
//!
//! The functions are emitted once for each implementation of AES
//! (`vg_aes_expand_key` and `vg_aes_ctr32`) and of `vg_ghash` they call,
//! which have the same contracts: on x86-64, CPUs with AES-NI and SSSE3 run
//! the `_aesni` instances (with `vg_aes_ctr32_aesni`), CPUs with PCLMULQDQ
//! and SSSE3 the `_pclmul` ones (with `vg_ghash_pclmul`), and CPUs with all
//! three the `_aesni_pclmul` ones; CPUs with VAES or VPCLMULQDQ (and AVX2)
//! run, instead of AES-NI's or PCLMULQDQ's, the `_vaes` or `_vpclmul`
//! instances (with `vg_aes_ctr32_vaes` and `vg_ghash_vpclmul`, sixteen and
//! eight blocks at a time in 256-bit registers), or those of the pairs
//! (`_vaes_vpclmul`, `_vaes_pclmul`, `_aesni_vpclmul`), and CPUs with VAES,
//! VPCLMULQDQ, AVX512F and AVX512BW the `_vaes_vpclmul_avx512` ones, whose
//! interleaved counter mode and GHASH work in 512-bit registers, and CPUs
//! with AES-NI, PCLMULQDQ and AVX but neither VAES nor VPCLMULQDQ the
//! `_aesni_pclmul_avx` ones, which interleave them in 128-bit registers
//! (where the `_aesni_pclmul` ones make two passes); likewise on x86, where
//! AES-NI needs no SSSE3 (and the 256-bit instances are not built); on AArch64, CPUs with the AES and PMULL extensions (which Rust's
//! `aes` feature stands for together) run the `_aes` ones (with
//! `vg_aes_ctr32_aes` and `vg_ghash_aes`).
