//! Wiping secrets from memory the library owns.
//!
//! What is wiped:
//!
//! * ML-KEM, ML-DSA, Ed25519, ECDSA, X25519, X448 and RSA wipe their
//!   private keys when they are dropped, and the intermediate values and
//!   working space of each operation (FIPS 203 §3.3, FIPS 204 §3.6.3).
//! * Every other object holding key material (the ciphers, AEADs and MACs,
//!   and the hash functions, whose state represents the key under HMAC,
//!   PBKDF2 or keyed BLAKE2) wipes it when it is dropped.
//! * The password KDFs' `verify` functions wipe the key they derive once
//!   they have compared it with the expected one.
//!
//! What is not: the working space (`scratch`) of the symmetric algorithms'
//! calls, and the copies of states the Rust code makes on the stack when
//! it moves or copies them (e.g. the context of each ChaCha20-Poly1305
//! call, which holds the key, or the blocks of PBKDF2 and scrypt), which
//! the next calls overwrite; and anything once it has been returned to the
//! caller (e.g. a MAC, a derived key or a shared secret), whose wiping is
//! the caller's.
