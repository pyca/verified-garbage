//! Raw RC4 (ARCFOUR), with an incremental keystream and no initial discard.
//!
//! RC4 is obsolete and insecure; this module exists for legacy compatibility.
//! It provides no nonce or authentication. Initialization and in-place XOR
//! are the verified primitives (`VG.Spec.Rc4.initContract` and
//! `VG.Spec.Rc4.applyContract`). Secret indices never address memory: on
//! AArch64 the permutation stays in sixteen AdvSIMD registers for a whole
//! call, read with `tbl`/`tbx` and written with `cmeq`/`bit`; on x86-64, x86
//! and 32-bit Arm the primitives scan it at fixed addresses with masked
//! quadwords (x86-64) and 32-bit words. Only pointers, lengths and the stream
//! position modulo 256 may affect the leakage trace.
