//! HMAC (FIPS 198-1, RFC 2104), for any hash function with a verified HMAC

//!
//! The construction is the same for every hash function `H` ([`HmacHash`]);
//! what each one provides, in a module of its own here, is verified
//! assembly for a key of at most one block, which computes
//! `H((K₀ ⊕ opad) ‖ H((K₀ ⊕ ipad) ‖ text))` (`VG.Spec.Hmac.hmacBlockKey`).
//! The only unverified step is step 2 of FIPS 198-1 §4: a key longer than a
//! block is first hashed, with the verified hash function.
