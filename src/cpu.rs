//! CPU features, for choosing among implementations of a primitive.
//!
//! Some artifacts use instructions beyond their target's baseline ISA. Lean
//! checks which CPU features those need, and the emitter generates a
//! [`Features`] constant of them, `<NAME>_FEATURES`, next to the function
//! (and lists them in its `# Safety` section): the function may only be
//! called on a CPU that has all of them. They are detected once: with `cpuid` on x86 and x86-64; on AArch64,
//! by asking the operating system with the `cpu-features-env` feature (which
//! links `std`), and otherwise from the target features the code was
//! compiled for. Each object that can use such a function chooses its
//! implementation when it is created, from the features detected. A feature
//! detection does not know ([`NAMES`]) cannot be checked for:
//! [`Features::of`] panics on it, so a generated constant naming one fails
//! to compile.
//!
//! With the `cpu-features-env` Cargo feature, the environment variable
//! `VG_CPU_FEATURES` restricts the features detected, so that tests and
//! benchmarks can run every implementation on one machine: `none`, or a
//! comma-separated list of the names in [`NAMES`] (e.g. `aes,pclmulqdq`).
//! Unset or empty, it restricts nothing. It can only remove features, so it
//! can never choose code the CPU cannot run, and it names only features
//! this library knows and the CPU has: anything else panics, rather than
//! quietly testing another configuration. On AArch64, standalone hashing
//! chooses FEAT_SHA3's Keccak only when this variable names `sha3`, since
//! it is not faster there. ML-DSA independently selects its faster paired
//! SHA3 implementation whenever the detected features support it.
