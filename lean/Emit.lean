# The emitter

Renders every artifact (those of each registration file under `VerifiedGarbage/Artifacts/`, and of each
generic file under `VerifiedGarbage/Generic/` for each variant under
`VerifiedGarbage/Variants/`, see `VerifiedGarbage/TCB/Emit.lean`) into Rust: each target's
functions into a crate of its own, `crates/verified-garbage-asm-<target>/src/` (ARM's `asm/`; DIR, by
default `../crates`, relative to `lean/`). Run it from `lean/` after
`lake build` (which checks every proof):

* `lake env lean --run Emit.lean [DIR]` writes the files (and deletes stale
  `.rs` files).
* `lake env lean --run Emit.lean --check [DIR]` writes nothing and fails if
  the files on disk differ from what would be generated; CI runs this.

It writes a program for each target directory that imports its
registration files (`.lake/emit/Driver<Target>.lean`, `VG.Emit.parts`) and
runs them at once, as processes with the same arguments, each auditing and
emitting the artifacts of its targets (`VG.Emit.run`'s `--part`); and then,
if they all pass, checks that no target is in two of them and writes or
checks the root module (`VG.Emit.finish`). (They are run by the
interpreter rather than as a `lean_exe` so that CI does not have to compile
Mathlib to native code.) The interpreter runs the trusted base, which
does the printing and checking, as the compiled code of the `NativeTCB`
libraries (`lakefile.toml`: one of what no target owns, and one per target),
which `lake build` builds, and so an order of magnitude faster.

/-- On Linux, a process may map at most `vm.max_map_count` regions of memory,
and the driver maps each module it imports, with its `.olean.server` and
`.olean.private` parts, since it is not a module and sees every module's
private part. Past the limit, Lean fails with `failed to read file
'….olean.private'`, naming whichever module it was loading. The driver
needed about six regions per `.olean` (80,144 for 13,700); require eight.
