# Lean: specifications, implementations and proofs

The cryptographic primitives (e.g. a block function or a field
multiplication) are assembly written in Lean as structured programs over a
Lean model of each ISA, proven correct in Lean, and printed into `src/asm/`
as Rust naked functions. The crate's public APIs are Rust that composes those
primitives: this directory verifies the primitives, not the Rust around them.

## Layout

```
VerifiedGarbage/
  TCB/          Trusted computing base: definitions only, Lean core only
    Mem.lean        byte-addressed memory, regions
    Code.lean       structured programs, calls and stack frames, big-step semantics
                    with leakage, constant time
    Print.lean      lowering of structured control flow to labels and branches, of
                    calls to call instructions, and of frames to push and pop
    Sig.lean        Rust signatures and calling conventions (`Abi`)
    Artifact.lean   Target, Contract, `Verified`, `Artifact`: what "verified" means;
                    `Sig.contract`: the contract obligations a signature implies
    Rust.lean       rendering artifacts as Rust naked functions; checks that every
                    call is of the artifact whose code the model runs for it, and
                    that each artifact declares the CPU features its code needs
    Axioms.lean     `#assert_standard_axioms`
    Audit.lean      `#assert_no_compiler_overrides` (the compiled code the emitter
                    runs is what the kernel checked) and `#assert_spec_origin`
                    (`VG.Spec` definitions are declared in `Spec/`)
    Emit.lean       what is emitted (`Artifacts.lean`, every registration file
                    under `Artifacts/`, and every generic function under `Generic/`
                    for every variant of its interface under `Variants/`), and
                    writing or checking `src/asm/`
    X86_64/         ISA model, printer, System V ABI target
  Spec/         Algorithm specifications and contracts (trusted, must be reviewed)
  Impl/         Implementations: `Prog`s over an ISA model (untrusted)
  Proof/        Proofs and intermediate proof artifacts (untrusted)
    Framework/      generic lemmas: determinism, WP rules, memory frames, inlining
                    verified code, and a taint-tracking checker that proves
                    constant time by evaluation
  Artifacts/      The registry: one registration file per algorithm and target,
                  each listing the artifacts it emits
  Variants/       Implementations of an interface that generic callers call: one
                  file per implementation, `Variants/<Iface>/<Target>/<Name>.lean`
  Generic/        Callers proven for any variant of an interface, emitted once per
                  variant: `Generic/<Iface>/<Target>/<Alg>.lean`; callers of several
                  interfaces, once per combination of their variants:
                  `Generic/<Iface₁>/<Iface₂>/<Target>/<Alg>.lean`, each instance
                  named by `Emit.qualifiedName` (a tag and the suffix of each
                  interface's non-baseline variant: `vg_argon2_blake2b_avx2_g_avx512`)
  Artifacts.lean  An empty list, which the emitter still reads; add nothing to it
VerifiedGarbageTest/  Golden tests for the (unverified) printers and calling conventions
Emit.lean       Renders every artifact into `../src/asm/` (see `TCB/Emit.lean`)
EmitOne.lean    The same, for the registration files named, while iterating
```

`ci/check_lean_imports.py` enforces the import discipline between these
directories: `TCB/` imports only Lean core and itself; `Spec/` and `Impl/`
never import proofs.

## The pipeline

1. **Spec** — `Spec/<Alg>.lean` defines the algorithm as a readable Lean
   function transcribed from the standard, and `Spec/<Alg>/Contract.lean`
   each function's Rust signature (`Sig`) and its `Contract`, for every
   target at once: `Sig.contract` derives from the signature and the
   target's calling convention where the arguments are, the permitted memory
   regions, disjointness and which arguments are public, and the contract
   adds a postcondition (in terms of the spec) and any further precondition.
   Each function's `Api` gives its Rust module, name and signature, its
   contract on every target (`contracts`), and its documentation, but for
   what the emitter derives from the signature.
2. **Impl** — `Impl/<Alg>/<Target>.lean` defines the code as a `Prog`.
3. **Proof** — `Proof/<Alg>/…` proves `Verified target code contract`:
   termination without faults (hence memory safety), the postcondition,
   the ABI obligations (callee-saved registers etc.), constant time (up to
   anything the contract declares the function may leak), and
   satisfiability of the precondition.
4. **Registry** — the registration files `Artifacts/<Alg>/<Target>.lean`
   list every `Artifact`, bundling target, Rust name and signature, code,
   contract and proof: mostly a function's `Api`, with the stack its contract
   gives its calls (`stack`) and any notes on the implementation. An artifact
   made from an `Api` takes the contract from it with the name and signature
   (`Api.contracts`), and must be proven against exactly that contract on its
   target (`Artifact.ofApi`), so a registration file, or a proof building
   artifacts for a generic caller, cannot pair a function's name with another
   function's contract; the emitter refuses an artifact that is not made from
   an `Api` with a contract. An `Artifact` cannot be built
   without the proof, and the emitter's `#assert_standard_axioms` rejects
   `sorry`, `native_decide` and any non-standard axiom anywhere in them. The
   emitter runs compiled code, so it also rejects anything that makes the
   compiler run other code than the definitions the kernel checked, in what
   it runs (`implemented_by`, `extern`, `export`) or anywhere in the project
   (`csimp`, `initialize`), and any `VG.Spec` definition declared outside
   `Spec/`.
5. **Emit** — `Emit.lean` renders the registry into `src/asm/<target>/<module>.rs`,
   adding to each function's `# Safety` section what its contract requires of
   the memory each buffer is valid for (`Sig.validDoc`) and of where its
   buffers are, which depends on the target's calling convention and the
   stack it uses (`Sig.layoutDoc`), from the same signature, `stack` and
   `writeArgs` as the contract, as `Artifact.ofSig` proves.
   CI fails if the checked-in files differ from what Lean generates, so the
   Rust crate contains exactly the verified code.

A function can call another (`Code.call name body`): the model runs the
callee's code `body` between the call and return instructions, so the
caller's proof covers it, and the emitter only emits the call if `name` is
the artifact whose code is `body`. A caller's proof can use the callee's
`Verified` proof rather than go through its code again.

Code saves registers on the stack, or passes arguments on the stack, in a
stack frame (`Code.frame push body pop`): the push moves the stack pointer
down, stores registers and makes those bytes a writable region; the pop
faults unless the stack pointer and regions are as the push left them, loads
one register and removes the region. Frames are nested by construction, so
the stack pointer is always back where it was, and the stack a function's
calls and frames use is part of its contract (`Sig.contract`'s `stack`).

Instructions outside a target's baseline ISA (e.g. SHA-NI) name the CPU
features they need (`ISA.requires`, transcribed from the vendor manual). An
artifact using them declares those features (`Artifact.features`), the
emitter checks the declaration is exact, and the generated function's
`# Safety` section makes their presence the caller's obligation. The Rust
that calls it checks for them first, using the generated `<NAME>_FEATURES`
constant.

## What you need to trust

* `TCB/` — in particular the ISA models, which must match the vendor manuals
  (including the CPU features each instruction requires), and the printers,
  which must print what the models mean.
* For each artifact: its contract in `Spec/` (and the algorithm spec it
  refers to), its `sig` and `doc` (its `Api` in `Spec/`, and any notes its
  registration file adds), and `TCB/Emit.lean`, which decides what is emitted.
* Lean's kernel, and the assembler in `rustc`/LLVM.

Everything in `Impl/` and `Proof/` is checked by Lean and need not be read.

To keep review of the trusted parts focused, new specs, additions to the TCB,
and new implementations are never combined in one PR: an implementation is
only proven against a spec and TCB that were reviewed and merged beforehand.

## Building

```sh
lake exe cache get                  # download prebuilt Mathlib
lake build                          # check every proof, run the axiom audit and golden tests
lake env lean --run Emit.lean       # regenerate ../src/asm
lake env lean --run Emit.lean --check
lake env lean --run EmitOne.lean [--check] Rc2.AArch64   # one registration file
```

## Restoring the CI build cache

After CI passes on `main`, it publishes the Linux x86-64 project build and
Mathlib dependencies to `ghcr.io/pyca/vg-lean-cache:latest`. The image contains
one file, `/lean-cache.tar.zst`, with `.lake/build` and `.lake/packages`
relative to `lean/`. Only the latest image version is retained. CI compares
the checked build's cache key with the image's `io.pyca.lean.cache-key` label
and skips packaging and publishing when it matches, so Rust- or docs-only
changes do not create a new cache version.

With Docker and zstd installed, restore it from the repository root:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/pyca/vg-lean-cache:latest
container=$(docker create ghcr.io/pyca/vg-lean-cache:latest /unused)
set -o pipefail
docker cp "$container":/lean-cache.tar.zst - | tar -xOf - | zstd -dc | tar --no-same-owner -xf - -C lean
docker rm "$container"
```

The container never runs. Install the toolchain in `lean/lean-toolchain`
separately; the image's `io.pyca.lean.toolchain` and
`org.opencontainers.image.revision` labels identify the cached build. Lake
rebuilds outputs that differ from the checkout. Private package access
requires authenticating to GHCR before pulling.

Keep `--no-same-owner`: the archive's files belong to CI's runner user, and
`tar` run as root (as in a container) would keep that owner. Git then refuses
the dependencies' checkouts in `.lake/packages` as owned by someone else, so
Lake clones them again and builds Mathlib from source.

Moving the cache to a different absolute path can also make Lake relink
native libraries and rebuild affected native modules. A normal `lake build`
handles this; the restored cache need not pass `lake build --no-build` for
every project target immediately after extraction.
