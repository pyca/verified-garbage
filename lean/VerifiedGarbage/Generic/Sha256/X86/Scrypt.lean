# scrypt (RFC 7914 §6) on x86, over SHA-256

A generic file (see `TCB/Emit.lean`): `vg_scrypt`, calling the
`vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_scratch` made with the backend's SHA-256 functions (and
`vg_scrypt_romix`), is emitted for every x86 SHA-256 backend, named with its
suffix (e.g. `vg_scrypt_shani`), and needs its CPU features.

The stack is 116 bytes: a 36-byte frame, the return address of a call, and
the 76 bytes `vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_scratch` uses.
