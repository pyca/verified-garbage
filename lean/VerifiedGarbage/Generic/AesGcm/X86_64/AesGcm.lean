# AES-GCM (NIST SP 800-38D) on x86-64

A generic file (see `TCB/Emit.lean`): the artifacts it lists, calling the
implementations `v` of `vg_aes_expand_key`, `vg_aes_ctr32` and `vg_ghash`,
are emitted once for each combination (`Variants/AesGcm/X86_64/`), named with
its suffix (e.g. `vg_aes_gcm_seal_aesni_pclmul`), and need its CPU features.
**Review note**: `sig` and `doc` are trusted, as they tie the Rust caller to
the contract; these artifacts are made from each function's `Api` (in
`Spec/`, reviewed with the contract), and this file adds only notes on the
implementation. The emitter adds the `# Safety` items that depend on the
target (`Sig.layoutDoc`), from `stack` and `writeArgs`, which `ofSig` checks
against the contract.

Each function needs the CPU features of the implementations it calls:
`init` calls only AES's, `stream_init` and `stream_aad` only GHASH's (so
their `_aesni` or `_pclmul` instances are the baseline code under another
name, which keeps every instance of a combination callable together).

`seal`, `open`, `stream_encrypt` and `stream_decrypt` encrypt or decrypt
and absorb the whole blocks of the data in one call of the instance of
`vg_aes_gcm_encrypt_blocks` or `vg_aes_gcm_decrypt_blocks` for the same
combination, which interleaves the two for the implementations that allow
it (`GcmImpl.stitch`).

The stack is 8 bytes for the other functions: the return address of a call
of `vg_aes_expand_key`, `vg_aes_ctr32` or `vg_ghash`, which make no calls.
`seal`, `open`, `stream_encrypt` and `stream_decrypt` need 24: the argument
they pass on the stack, the return address of their call of
`vg_aes_gcm_encrypt_blocks` or `vg_aes_gcm_decrypt_blocks`, and that of its
calls.
