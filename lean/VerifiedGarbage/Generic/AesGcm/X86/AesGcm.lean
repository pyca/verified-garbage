# AES-GCM (NIST SP 800-38D) on x86

A generic file (see `TCB/Emit.lean`): the artifacts it lists, calling the
implementations `v` of `vg_aes_ctr32` with its `vg_aes_expand_key` and of
`vg_ghash`, are emitted once for each combination (`Variants/AesGcm/X86/`),
named with its suffix (e.g. `vg_aes_gcm_seal_aesni_pclmul`), and need its CPU
features: `init` only AES's, `stream_init` and `stream_aad` only GHASH's.
**Review note**: `sig` and `doc` are trusted, as they tie the Rust caller
to the contract; check them against the contract's `pre`/`post`. An
artifact made from a function's `Api` (in `Spec/`, reviewed with the
contract) takes them from there, and this file adds only notes on the
implementation. The emitter adds the `# Safety` items that depend on the
target (`Sig.layoutDoc`), from `stack` and `writeArgs`, which `ofSig` checks
against the contract.

Each function calls `vg_aes_ctr32` (six stack arguments) or `vg_ghash`
(five) in a frame of its own, so uses 28 bytes of stack with the return
address (24 for `stream_init` and `stream_aad`, which call only
`vg_ghash`). Every function also keeps its working space in a frame of its own, which
copies its arguments passed on the stack: 2580 bytes for `init`, 2584 for
`stream_init`, 2592 for `stream_aad`, 2600 for `stream_finish`, 2604 for
`stream_encrypt`, `stream_decrypt`, `stream_verify` and `seal`, and 2608 for
`open`.
