      caller's callee-saved registers in `scratch`; field elements are four 64-bit words in \
      Montgomery form, multiplied by word-by-word Montgomery multiplication (CIOS) with a final \
      conditional subtraction. The peer's key is checked without branches (its first byte, both \
      coordinates below `p`, and the curve's equation), and the ladder multiplies the peer's \
      point if it is valid, else `G`, so it always runs on a point of the curve. `[d]P` is a \
      double-and-add ladder over all 256 bits of `d`, with the complete addition formulas of \
      Renes, Costello and Batina and a masked selection for each bit; `Z⁻¹` is Fermat's, by \
      square-and-always-multiply. The result (or zeros) is selected by a mask of the checks, `d` \
      in `[1, n-1]` and `Z ≠ 0`, so the time depends only on the pointers."])
