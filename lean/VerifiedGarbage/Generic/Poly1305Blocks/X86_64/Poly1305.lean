# Streaming Poly1305 (RFC 8439 §2.5) on x86-64

A generic file (see `TCB/Emit.lean`): the artifacts it lists, which absorb the
whole blocks of the data with an implementation `v` of `vg_poly1305_blocks`,
are emitted once for each implementation (`Variants/Poly1305Blocks/X86_64/`),
named with its suffix (e.g. `vg_poly1305_update_avx2`), and need its CPU
features. `init` and `finalize` call no implementation of it, and are in the
registration file.

The stack is 160 bytes for every implementation: the frame of 136 bytes
holding the working space, the return address of the call of
`vg_poly1305_blocks`, and up to 16 bytes for its own calls.
