# ChaCha20-Poly1305 (RFC 8439 §2.8) on x86-64

A generic file (see `TCB/Emit.lean`): the artifacts it lists, calling an
implementation `v` of `vg_chacha20_xor`, are emitted once for each
implementation (`Variants/ChaCha20Xor/X86_64/`), named with its suffix (e.g.
`vg_chacha20_poly1305_seal_avx2`), and need its CPU features and those of
the implementation of `vg_poly1305_blocks` it comes with (`XorImpl.poly`). **Review
note**: `sig` and `doc` are trusted, as they tie the Rust caller to the
contract; check them against the contract's `pre`/`post`. An artifact made
from a function's `Api` (in `Spec/`, reviewed with the contract) takes them
from there, and this file adds only notes on the implementation. The emitter
adds the `# Safety` items that depend on the target (`Sig.layoutDoc`), from
`stack` and `writeArgs`, which `ofSig` checks against the contract.

Each function keeps its working space (608 bytes, `work`) in a frame of 632
bytes on the stack, which also holds a copy of `tag` and the address of
`work` (`withStackArgScratchWiped`) and is zeroed after the code, as it holds
the one-time Poly1305 key and keystream. The code below the frame uses 24
bytes of stack for every implementation: the return address of the call of
`vg_chacha20_xor`, and up to 16 bytes for its own calls; 656 bytes in all.
