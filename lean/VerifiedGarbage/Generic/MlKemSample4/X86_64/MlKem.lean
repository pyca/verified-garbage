# ML-KEM-768 and ML-KEM-1024 (FIPS 203) on x86-64: key generation, encapsulation (with `H(ek)` given) and decapsulation

A generic file (see `TCB/Emit.lean`): the artifacts it lists, which sample the
matrix `Â` four entries at a time with an implementation `v` of
`vg_mlkem_sample_ntt4` (and compute the outputs of `PRF` as goes with it), are
emitted once for each implementation (`Variants/MlKemSample4/X86_64/`), named
with its suffix (e.g. `vg_mlkem768_keygen_avx2`), and need its CPU features.
Both parameter sets are the same code and proofs for their layouts
(`Impl/MlKem/X86_64/Kem.lean`).
