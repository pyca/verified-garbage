# scrypt (RFC 7914 §6) on x86-64, over SHA-256

A generic file (see `TCB/Emit.lean`): `vg_scrypt`, calling the
`vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_scratch` made with the variant's SHA-256 compression function
(and `vg_scrypt_romix`), is emitted for every SHA-256 variant carried by
`MdHash.sha256`, named with its suffix (e.g. `vg_scrypt_shani`), and needs its
CPU features. Other hash functions emit no scrypt artifact.

The stack is 88 bytes: a 56-byte frame, the return address of a call, and
the 24 bytes `vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_scratch`'s own calls use.
