# Ed25519 (RFC 8032) on x86-64, over SHA-512

Complete key derivation, cached-key signing, and verification are emitted
for every SHA-512 compression backend carried by `MdHash.sha512`, and for
each field multiplication of the Ed25519 functions they call (the baseline's,
and BMI2's and ADX's, `_adx`), and verification for its doublings with
AVX512_IFMA (`_ifma`). Each operation includes its streaming hash calls and
carries the backend's suffix and CPU features, then the field's.
Other hash families emit no Ed25519 artifacts.
