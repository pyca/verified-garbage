# scrypt (RFC 7914 §6) on AArch64, over SHA-256

A generic file (see `TCB/Emit.lean`): `vg_scrypt`, calling the
`vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_scratch` made with the variant's SHA-256 compression function
(and `vg_scrypt_romix`), is emitted for every SHA-256 variant carried by
`MdHash.sha256`, named with its suffix (e.g. `vg_scrypt_sha2`), and needs its
CPU features. Other hash functions emit no scrypt artifact.

The stack is 96 bytes: a 16-byte frame saving `x30`, a 64-byte one, and the
16 bytes the frames of the functions called may use.
