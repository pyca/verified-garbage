# Streaming Merkle–Damgård hash functions on AArch64

A generic file (see `TCB/Emit.lean`): each variant's streaming `update` and
`finalize` made with its implementation of the compression function, named
with its suffix (e.g. `vg_sha256_update_sha2`). Those a family shares are carried by one member's variants (SHA-512's, for the
SHA-512 family); those of a hash function with one implementation (MD5) are
in its registration file.

The variant supplies each function's `Api` and its verified code
(`MdHash.stream`, a `StreamFn`), whose contract is the one the `Api` gives it
(`StreamFn.ofApi`, which this file passes on as the artifact's `ofApi`).
