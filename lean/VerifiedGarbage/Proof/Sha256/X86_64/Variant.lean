# Implementations of the SHA-256 compression function on x86-64

A `Compress` is what a function that calls the compression function needs
of it, so that its proof holds for every implementation: each makes
SHA-256 a variant of the interface `MdHash` on x86-64
(`Variants/MdHash/X86_64/Sha256*.lean`, `Proof/Pbkdf2/Md/X86_64/Hashes/Sha256.lean`),
and each function built on it (in `Generic/MdHash/X86_64/`) is emitted once
for each of them (see `TCB/Emit.lean`).
