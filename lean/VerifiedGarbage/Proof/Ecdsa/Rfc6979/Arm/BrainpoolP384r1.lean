# Deterministic ECDSA on 32-bit ARM: brainpoolP384r1

brainpoolP384r1 as the proof's curve (`brainpoolp384r1`): scalars of 6 64-bit words, the order
`n` of exactly 384 bits with `2^384 < 2 n`, and `vg_ecdsa_brainpoolp384r1_sign`, proven
correct (given the group law) and constant time against its contract
(`coreK` at brainpoolP384r1's sizes, which is `Proof.Ecdsa.Arm.BrainpoolP384r1.signArm`).
