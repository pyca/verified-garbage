# ECDSA verification over P-384 on x86-64: the code as a literal

The field arithmetic is unrolled, so the kernel would build the instructions
again in every check that evaluates the code (constant time, `spSafe`): the
literal of the code (`materialize_code`, `Proof/Framework/Lit.lean`) is
checked once here instead.
