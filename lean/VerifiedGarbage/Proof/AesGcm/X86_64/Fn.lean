# AES-GCM on x86-64: what every function does

Untrusted: everything here is checked by Lean. Each function saves our
caller's `rbx, rbp, r12–r15` at `W + 128` (`save_ok`) and restores them
(`restore_ok`); the pieces it runs in between never write there.

The postconditions quantify over what the state represents (the nonce, the
additional data, the text so far), which the code never looks at: each
function runs the same for all of them, so one run satisfies each instance
of its proof (`WP.forall_det`).
