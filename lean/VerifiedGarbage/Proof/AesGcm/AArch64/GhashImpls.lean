# AES-GCM on AArch64: `vg_ghash_aes`

Untrusted: everything here is checked by Lean. The `GhashImpl` of
`vg_ghash_aes`, from its proof, apart from `Callee.lean`: only the variants
need it, and its proof imports the algebra of `Proof/Gcm/Poly.lean`, which
the rest of the AES-GCM proofs then need not import.
