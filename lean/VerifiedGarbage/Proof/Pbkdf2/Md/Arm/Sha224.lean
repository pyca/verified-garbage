# HMAC-SHA-224 and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-224 over the compression function on ARMv7

SHA-224 as a `Hash`: its streaming functions as the code calls them
(`sha224H`, `Proof/Pbkdf2/Stream/Arm/Sha224.lean`), SHA-256's hash value,
length field, digest code and compression function (`Sha256.lean`); what the
proofs need of it (`HashOK`), with SHA-256's `Md` from SHA-224's initial hash
value and the digest its first 28 bytes; and the generic proofs at it, moved
to the shared contracts of `Spec.Hmac.sha224I` (as for the hash functions of
`Instances.lean`).
