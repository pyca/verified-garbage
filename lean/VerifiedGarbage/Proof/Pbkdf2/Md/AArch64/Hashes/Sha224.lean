# SHA-224 on AArch64, as a Merkle–Damgård hash function

SHA-224 with an implementation of SHA-256's compression function, as a variant
of `MdHash` (`variant`), from which HMAC and PBKDF2 are emitted
(`Generic/MdHash/AArch64/`): its streaming code is SHA-256's, the generic
Merkle–Damgård code (`Stream.params`) from SHA-224's initial hash value
(`vg_sha224_init`), its specification `Spec.Hmac.sha224S`, with the digest the
first 28 bytes of the final hash value. The facts about the code HMAC and
PBKDF2 add, which do not depend on the functions they call, are checked once
(`coreOK`).

Its streaming `update` and `finalize` are SHA-256's, which SHA-256's
variants carry (`Proof/Pbkdf2/Md/AArch64/Hashes/Sha256.lean`): SHA-224's
carry none.
