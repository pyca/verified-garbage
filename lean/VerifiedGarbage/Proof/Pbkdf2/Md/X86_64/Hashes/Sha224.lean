# SHA-224 on x86-64, as a Merkle–Damgård hash function

SHA-224 with an implementation `v` of SHA-256's compression function
(`Proof/Sha256/X86_64/Variant.lean`), as a variant of `MdHash` (`variant v`),
from which HMAC and PBKDF2 are emitted (`Generic/MdHash/X86_64/`): its
streaming code is SHA-256's, the generic Merkle–Damgård code (`Stream.params`)
from SHA-224's initial hash value (`vg_sha224_init`), its specification
`Spec.Hmac.sha224S`, with the digest the first 28 bytes of the final hash
value. The facts about the code HMAC and PBKDF2 add, which do not depend on
`v`, are checked once (`coreOK`).

Its streaming `update` and `finalize` are SHA-256's, which SHA-256's
variants carry (`Proof/Pbkdf2/Md/X86_64/Hashes/Sha256.lean`): SHA-224's
carry none.
