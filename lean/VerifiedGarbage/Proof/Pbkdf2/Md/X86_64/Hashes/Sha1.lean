# SHA-1 on x86-64, as a Merkle–Damgård hash function

SHA-1 with an implementation `v` of its compression function
(`Proof/Sha1/X86_64/Variant.lean`), as a variant of `MdHash` (`variant v`), from
which HMAC and PBKDF2 are emitted (`Generic/MdHash/X86_64/`): its streaming code
is the generic Merkle–Damgård code (`Stream.params`), its specification
`Spec.Hmac.sha1S`. The facts about the code HMAC and PBKDF2 add, which do not
depend on `v`, are checked once (`coreOK`).

`stream v` are the streaming `update` and `finalize` made with `v` (and
their `_scratch` forms, which HMAC and PBKDF2 call), which
`Generic/MdHash/X86_64/Stream.lean` emits from their `Api`s, named with
its suffix.
