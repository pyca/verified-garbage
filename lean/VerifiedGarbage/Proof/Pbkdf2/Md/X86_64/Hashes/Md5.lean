# MD5 on x86-64, as a Merkle–Damgård hash function

MD5, with its one implementation of the compression function, as a variant of
`MdHash` (`variant`), from which HMAC and PBKDF2 are emitted
(`Generic/MdHash/X86_64/`): its streaming code is the generic Merkle–Damgård
code (`Stream.params`), its specification `Spec.Hmac.md5S`. Its streaming
`update` and `finalize` are in its registration file
(`Artifacts/Md5/X86_64.lean`).
