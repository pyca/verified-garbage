# Complete projective addition (Renes, Costello and Batina)

Algorithm 1 of Renes, Costello and Batina, "Complete addition formulas for
prime order elliptic curves" (EUROCRYPT 2016): the sum of two points
`(X₁ : Y₁ : Z₁)` and `(X₂ : Y₂ : Z₂)` of `Y²Z = X³ + aXZ² + bZ³`, for any
`a`, with `b3 = 3b`, in its 40 steps, as the implementations compute it:
over any commutative ring of Lean's core (`Lean.Grind.CommRing`), so that
the implementations' proofs compute it in `Fin p` without importing
Mathlib's algebra, which only the proofs of the group law need.
