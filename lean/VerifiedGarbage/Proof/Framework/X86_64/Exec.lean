/-! Symbolic execution of a block, one instruction at a time (see `runStep`).
These are deliberately not proved by `rfl`: `simp` would use an `rfl` lemma
as a definitional unfolding, which the kernel then re-checks by unfolding the
structural recursion of `runBlock` over the whole remaining block, at every
instruction. -/
