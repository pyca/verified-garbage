# The vectors' upper halves in two runs of the same path (x86-64)

Two runs of the same code whose traces agree, one a prefix of the other's
continuation, take the same path: their blocks leak as many addresses
whatever the state (`addrs_length`), so the traces split alike, and each
branch, loop test and indirect call is observed (a branch's direction, the
address an indirect call calls, which is the function of the chain whose
address it is, the same in both runs if their functions' addresses are).
Along that path, the upper halves of `zmm0`–`zmm15` (`ymmHi`, `zmmHi`)
agree after code that keeps them (level 0, `Instr.vecLevel`) if they agreed
before it, and after `vzeroupper`, which zeroes them, whatever they were.
`up` follows this through the code (`up c true`: they agree at the end if
they agreed at the start), so that code of the baseline ISA that calls,
through tables of functions, functions with AVX instructions that end with
`vzeroupper` leaves the upper halves as its caller left them, or zero, the
same in two runs that take the same path (`lock`).
