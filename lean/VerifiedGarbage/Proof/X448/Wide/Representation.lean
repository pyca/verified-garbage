# Headroom-aware X448 field representation

Untrusted: this is an internal arithmetic contract for an eight-word backend.
A representative has a value modulo p and a separate, explicit coefficient
bound. Weak reduction need not normalize every coefficient below the radix.
The public RFC 7748 contract and existing backend contract are unchanged.
