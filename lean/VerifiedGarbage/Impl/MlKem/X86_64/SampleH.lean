# ML-KEM on x86-64: three entries of the matrix and three blocks of `H(ek)` at once

`sampleH` is a fragment that encapsulation inlines (not a function), with
the interface of `vg_mlkem_sample_ntt4_avx2` (`Sample4.lean`): `seeds` in
`rdi`, `a` in `rsi` and `scratch` in `rdx`. It runs `SampleNTT` on the first
three seeds to the first three polynomials from `a`, as
`vg_mlkem_sample_ntt4_avx2` does, while the fourth state of the four
Keccak states, which that function uses for a fourth seed, absorbs three
blocks of the input of `H = SHA3-256` (rate 136): the state of that sponge
is at `scratch + 6720` (`oHS`, 200 bytes, as `[u64; 25]`), and the three
blocks at `scratch + 6920` (`oHB`, 408 bytes), past what the sampling uses.

The code is `vg_mlkem_sample_ntt4_avx2`'s with three changes:

1. After the padded seeds are written to the four states, the fourth state
   is overwritten with the sponge's state (`hload`).
2. Each of the three squeezes first XORs the next block (17 lanes, from
   `r8`, which the permutation keeps) into the fourth state (`hxor`), so
   that its permutation is the sponge's absorption of that block.
3. After the three squeezes, the fourth state is stored back as the
   sponge's (`hsave`), and only the first three seeds are sampled
   (`run1 0` to `run1 2`, then `tail3`): if one of them has fewer than 256
   coefficients, the two more squeezes permute all four states again (the
   fourth is no longer needed), and each of the three runs 112 more
   iterations.

The fourth state's output is copied to the fourth buffer, which nothing
reads. The XOR and the copies have fixed addresses, so the sponge's state
and blocks do not affect timing; the sampling's branches and addresses
depend on the first three seeds only.

/-! ## Two outputs of `PRF₂` in the fourth state

`sampleP` runs `SampleNTT` on the first three seeds as `sampleHM fast 0`
does, while the fourth state computes `PRF₂(σ, 0)` and `PRF₂(σ, 1)`
(SHAKE256 of `σ ‖ N`, 128 bytes): before each of the first two squeezes it
is overwritten with the padded block of `σ ‖ N` (`σ` at `scratch + oPS`,
`r9` holding lane 4: `N` and SHAKE's suffix), and after it the first 128
bytes of its output go to `scratch + oPO + 128 N` (`r8`, which the
permutation keeps, as it keeps `r9`). The input of `PRF₂` is one block of
SHAKE256 (rate 136) and its output fewer bytes than the rate, so each is
one permutation. The stores have fixed addresses, so `σ` does not affect
timing. -/
