# ML-KEM on AArch64: helpers

Coefficients are `u32`s less than `q = 3329`, loaded with `ldr w` (which
zero-extends them) and computed on in 64-bit registers, where no
intermediate value wraps. A value less than `2q` is reduced with one
conditional subtraction without a branch (`csub`): `d - q` is negative
exactly when `d < q`, which its sign bit (bit 63) says, and `madd` adds `q`
back times that bit. The model has no flags, conditional select or
register-offset addressing: pointers advance by an immediate, and loops
count down to zero (`cbnz`).

`vg_mlkem_add` and `vg_mlkem_sub` compute in vectors
(`Impl/MlKem/AArch64/Ntt.lean`).
