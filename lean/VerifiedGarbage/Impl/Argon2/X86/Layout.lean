# Argon2 derivation on x86 (32-bit): the frame

`vg_argon2` keeps the caller's `ebx`, `esi`, `edi` and `ebp` in frames of
their own, then a frame of `locals` bytes, and points `ebp` at it for the
whole derivation. Its eighteen arguments (cdecl) are then at `[ebp + argOff i]`.
The locals are:

* `[0, 64)`: H₀, followed by LE32(column) and LE32(lane): the 72-byte input
  of H′ for the first two blocks of each lane;
* the pass, lane, slice and index of the filling loops, and the one-based
  counter of the address block in `scratch`;
* the lane length (in blocks and in bytes) and the segment length;
* the byte count of H₀'s input (64 bits), and temporaries.

Every value in the locals but H₀, the random word and the reference block
is public.
