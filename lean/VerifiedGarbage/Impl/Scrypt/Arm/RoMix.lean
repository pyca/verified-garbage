# scryptROMix: 32-bit ARM implementation

`romix(b = r0, r = r1, v = r2, vlen = r3, scratch = [sp], slen = [sp + 4])`
replaces the `128 * r` bytes at `b` by scryptROMix (RFC 7914 §5) of them,
with `N = vlen / r`, a power of two. `X` stays in `b`.

As on x86-64 and AArch64 (`Impl/Scrypt/X86_64/RoMix.lean`,
`Impl/Scrypt/AArch64/RoMix.lean`), step 2 runs `N` times: `V[i] = X` (a
copy), then `X = scryptBlockMix (V[i])`. Step 3 runs `N` times:
`j = Integerify (X) mod N` (the low 4 bytes of `X`'s last 64-byte block,
masked with `N - 1`: `N` is below `2^32`), then `T = X xor V[j]`, then
`X = scryptBlockMix (T)`. The model has no multiplication, so, as on
x86-64, the address of `V[j]`, `v + j * 128 r`, is computed by shifting and
adding over the bits of `j`.

`vg_scrypt_blockmix`'s stack argument, its scratch space, is ours: we make
the calls with the stack pointer we were entered with. `scratch`
(`128 (r + 2)` bytes) holds scryptBlockMix's working space (`[0, 128)`),
our caller's `r4`–`r9` and our return address (`[128, 156)`: there is no
stack frame), `N` (`[156, 160)`) and `T` (`[192, 192 + 128 r)`). Across the
calls, which preserve them, `r4` is `b`, `r5` is `v`, `r6` is `scratch`,
`r7` is `128 r` and `r8` counts the iterations left; `r9` is `V[i]` in step
2 and `N - 1` in step 3.

Every branch and address depends only on the pointers, `r`, `N` and the
indices `j`: the contract declares that the function leaks the `j`.
