# Point addition on a curve, in Montgomery form: its curves and working space

Not trusted: what the code of the curves' internal functions (`Rust.Internal`),
which only verified code calls, is generated from, and where it keeps its
numbers. Their contracts are in `Proof/Weierstrass/PointContract.lean`, in these
namespaces.
