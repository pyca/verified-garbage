# The multiplication of a curve's base point: its curves and the slots of their working space

Not trusted: what the code of the curves' internal functions (`Rust.Internal`),
which only verified code calls, is generated from, and where it keeps its
numbers. Their contracts are in `Proof/Weierstrass/MulBaseContract.lean`, in these
namespaces.

(its group, base point and prime `p`), its name (the function is
`vg_<curve>_mul_base`, in the Rust module `<curve>_mul_base`), the count `k`
of 64-bit words of a coordinate, with `p < 2^(64 k)`, how the documentation
names it, the slot of its products' temporary area, and whether every byte
from slot 45 on is the function's own working space too. -/
