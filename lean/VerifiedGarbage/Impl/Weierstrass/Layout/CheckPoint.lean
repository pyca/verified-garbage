# The check of a public point: its curves and the slots of their working space

Not trusted: what the code of the curves' internal functions (`Rust.Internal`),
which only verified code calls, is generated from, and where it keeps its
numbers. Their contracts are in `Proof/Weierstrass/CheckPointContract.lean`, in these
namespaces.

prime `p` and coefficients `a` and `b`), its name (the function is
`vg_<curve>_check_point`, in the Rust module `<curve>_check_point`), the
count `k` of 64-bit words of a number, with `p < 2^(64 k)`, and how the
documentation names it. -/
