# The multiplication of a point: its curves and the slots of their working space

Not trusted: what the code of the curves' internal functions (`Rust.Internal`),
which only verified code calls, is generated from, and where it keeps its
numbers. Their contracts are in `Proof/Weierstrass/MulContract.lean`, in these
namespaces.

/-- A curve whose points' multiplication is a function: the curve `W` (its
group and prime `p`), its name (the function is `vg_<curve>_mul`, in the
Rust module `<curve>_mul`), the count `k` of 64-bit words of a coordinate,
with `p < 2^(64 k)`, how the documentation names it, the slot of its
products' temporary area, the count of words past the table of bits
where the function may keep the callee-saved registers it changes, whether
slot 40 and every byte from slot 45 on are the function's own working space
too (`tail`), and whether the result is stated only for `k` in `[1, n - 1]`
(`inRange`). -/
