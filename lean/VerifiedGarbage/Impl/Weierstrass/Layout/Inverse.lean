# Inverses modulo a curve's prime and order: its curves and the slots of their working space

Not trusted: what the code of the curves' internal functions (`Rust.Internal`),
which only verified code calls, is generated from, and where it keeps its
numbers. Their contracts are in `Proof/Weierstrass/InverseContract.lean`, in these
namespaces.

order `n`), its name (the functions are `vg_<curve>_inv_mod_p` and

names it, the slot of its products' temporary area, and how many bytes its
working area has beyond `64 k + 64` (`workLen`). -/
