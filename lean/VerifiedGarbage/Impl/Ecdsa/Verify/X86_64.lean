# ECDSA signature verification on x86-64

`vg_ecdsa_<curve>_verify(public = rdi, digest = rsi, sig = rdx,
scratch = rcx) -> eax`, for a curve of `n` 64-bit words, from the code of
ECDSA's signature (`Impl/Ecdsa/X86_64.lean`) and of ECDH
(`Impl/Ecdh/X86_64.lean`), whose layout of the working space it uses:

1. `scratch` to `r8`, `public` to `r9`, `sig` to `rcx` (the signature's
   `k`), `public + 1` to `rdx` (its hash) and `sig + len` to `r10`; then
   the signature's setup and tables of bits: `r` is read into the slot of
   `k`, the hash into that of `d` (and shifted to `e`), the key's `x` into
   that of the hash; then `s` into `PT` (which only the powers use);
2. ECDH's checks of the key (`peer`, `validate`): its first byte, `x < p`,
   `y < p` and the curve's equation, into the flag, and the key's point, or
   `G` if the flag is clear, to the slots of ECDH's ladder;
3. the masks of `r` and `s` in `[1, n-1]` into the flag, and
   `w = s^(n-2)`, in Montgomery form modulo `n`;
4. `u = e w` and `v = r w` modulo `n`, out of Montgomery's form;
5. `[u]G` by the signature's comb, or its ladder for a curve without one
   (`Cfg.gMul`, from the table of `u`'s bits), saved
   to `U`, and `R` reset to `O`; then `[v]Q` by ECDH's ladder (from the
   table of `v`'s bits) and `[u]G + [v]Q` by the complete addition, into
   `R`;
6. `Z^(p-2)` by the signature's power, `x = X Z^(p-2)` out of Montgomery's
   form, and the masks of `Z ≠ 0` and `x R ≡ r R` modulo `n` into the
   flag, which is returned as 0 or 1.

Everything is computed whatever the flag, and only the pointers affect
timing, although the contract would let every input affect it.
