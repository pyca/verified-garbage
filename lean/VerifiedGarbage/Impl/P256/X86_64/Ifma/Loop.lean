# P-256 on x86-64 with AVX512_IFMA: the joint multiplication's loop

`vwindow` is `Joint.window` with the loop over the digits of both scalars
in vectors (`vloop`), from the generator's table: the accumulator in
`ymm0`–`ymm19` (`Point.lean`), doubled once for each digit (`dblPieces`),
and for each digit that is not zero the entry of the digit's point added
(`addPieces`), or taken as the accumulator if it is the first (`setPieces`).
The entry of a multiple of the generator is made of the point's words
(`convGPieces`); those of the odd multiples of `Q` are made once, before the
loop, in vectors too (`vtab`), and kept as limbs in the working space, from
which a digit's is loaded (`loadAPieces`, `loadBPieces`). The accumulator's
triple is then put back in the words of `R` (`outPieces`, `packLane`).

The additions are those of distinct points: where a digit's point is the
accumulator's or its negative, `Z` becomes zero and stays zero, and then
`Joint.window` is run instead, from the start.

`vpmadd52luq` and `vpmadd52huq` have MXCSR-configuration-dependent timing
on some processors, so the loop runs between Intel's prologue and epilogue
(`region`; see "MCDT" in `TCB/X86_64/Isa.lean`).
