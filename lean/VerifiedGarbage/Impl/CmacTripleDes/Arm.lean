# TDEA-CMAC (3DES-CMAC): 32-bit ARM implementation

`vg_cmac_triple_des_init(key = r0, key_len = r1, out = r2, scratch = r3)`,
`vg_cmac_triple_des_update(schedule = r0, state = r1, data = r2, n = r3, scratch = [sp])`
and `vg_cmac_triple_des_finalize(key = r0, state = r1, last = r2, last_len = r3, scratch = [sp])`
(see `VG.Spec.Cmac.tdesInitContract` and the others). Each encrypts blocks
with `block` (`Arm/Round.lean`), inline: the block as a big-endian 64-bit
integer in `r0:r1` (its high and low words), the key schedule at `r9` and
the scratch buffer at `r10`. The block uses every register, so the
functions keep their pointers and counts in the scratch buffer.

The scratch buffer: words 0–12 (bytes `[0, 52)`) are the block's; bytes
`[52, 88)` hold our caller's callee-saved registers `r4`–`r11` and `lr`;
`[88, 112)` are `init`'s three DES keys (each as its high and low words);
`[112, 124)` the output or state pointer, the data pointer and a count; and
`[124, 132)` `finalize`'s last block `Mₙ`.

* `init` reads the three DES keys (the third is the first for a 16-byte
  key), writes their round keys (`roundKeys`, 128 bytes each) to `out`
  (`r2`, advancing), and then encrypts the zero block with them (`L`) and
  doubles it twice, as a 64-bit integer: shifted left by one bit, and XORed
  with `0x1b` masked by the bit shifted out.
* `update` reloads the state and data pointers each block; after the
  block, it loads them and the count before it stores the state, and stores
  them back after.
* `finalize` forms `Mₙ` in `r4:r5` as little-endian words: `Mₙ* ⊕ K1` for a
  complete block, else `Mₙ*` copied a byte at a time onto zeros (through
  advancing pointers: the model has no register-offset addressing), `0x80`
  after it, and XORed with `K2`; it saves the state pointer only then.

Only the pointers, `key_len`, `n` and `last_len` can affect timing: the
branches are on them and on counters, and the doubling is masked.
