# ECDH on x86-64

`vg_ecdh_<curve>(out = rdi, d = rsi, peer = rdx, scratch = rcx) -> eax`,
for a curve of `n` 64-bit words, from the code of ECDSA's signature
(`Impl/Ecdsa/X86_64.lean`), whose layout of the working space it uses:

1. `scratch` to `r8`, `peer` to `r9`, `d`'s pointer to `rcx` (the
   signature's `k`) and `peer + 1` to `rdx` (its hash); then the
   signature's setup and tables of bits, unchanged: `d` is read into the
   slots of `k` and `d`, the peer's `x` into that of the hash;
2. `R² mod p` and `b R mod p` to slots of their own, the peer's `y` to
   another, and into the flag the masks of the peer's first byte being
   `04`, `x < p` and `y < p`;
3. `x` and `y` into Montgomery's form, and the mask of `y² = x³ + a x + b`
   into the flag;
4. the peer's point, or `G` if the flag is clear (so the scalar
   multiplication always runs on a point of the curve), to the slots it takes
   its point from;
5. `[d]P` by signed 4-bit windows for up to nine words (`WinCfg.window`, its
   table of `[1 … 8]P` past the tables of bits, with `b R mod p`
   for the complete addition for `a = -3`), else by the signature's ladder,
   and `Z^(p-2)` by its inversion (or power);
6. `x = X Z^(p-2)`, out of Montgomery's form, and the masks of `d` in
   `[1, n-1]` and `Z ≠ 0` into the flag, which selects `x` or zeros for
   `out` (big-endian) and is returned as 0 or 1.

Everything is computed whatever the flag, and only the pointers may affect
timing (the contract would let the peer's public key affect it too).
