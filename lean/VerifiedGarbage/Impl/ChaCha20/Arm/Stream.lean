# Streaming ChaCha20: 32-bit ARM implementation

`vg_chacha20_init(state = r0, key = r1, nonce = r2)`,
`vg_chacha20_set_nonce(state = r0, nonce = r1)` and
`vg_chacha20_apply(state = r0, data = r1, len = r2) -> r0`, on the streaming
state of `VG.Spec.ChaCha20.restAt` (768 bytes):

* `[0, 64)`: the 16-word state, `[64, 128)`: the buffered block,
  `[128, 136)`: the number of bytes of keystream left (64 bits, low word
  first);
* `[192, 256)`: the copy of the 16-word state that `vg_chacha20_xor` is
  given (it leaves its state unspecified), `[256, 576)`: its working space;
* `[576, 596)`: our caller's `r4`–`r7` and our return address `lr` (which
  each call replaces); `[600, 608)`: the number of bytes left after
  `apply`, stored there first since the block function overwrites
  `[64, 320)`.

`set_nonce` loads the nonce first, then stores it (words 12–15), the number
of bytes left, 64 × (2³² − c) for the initial block counter `c` (computed in
`r3:r12` with `subs` and `adc`, then shifted), and the constants; `init`
copies the key a word at a time first.

The model's branches test only Z, so `apply` moves the carry of each
comparison into a register (`adc` of zeros) and tests that. It first
compares the number of bytes left with `len`; if fewer are left it returns 0
at once. Otherwise it XORs the bytes left in the buffered block (the last
`left % 64`, as many as `len` asks for), then the whole blocks that follow
with `vg_chacha20_xor`, advancing the counter, and finally, if bytes remain,
computes the next block into the buffer with `vg_chacha20_block`, advances
the counter and XORs its first bytes. `r4` holds the state, `r5` the data
not yet processed and `r6` its length throughout, and `r7` the length of the
whole blocks across the call of `vg_chacha20_xor`: they are callee-saved, so
the callees keep them. A call (`bl`) stores nothing in memory, so no stack is
used.

The branches are on the length and the number of bytes left only, and every
address is a pointer plus a constant, or advances by one: only the pointers,
the length and the number of bytes left (which the contract lets `apply`
leak) can affect timing.
