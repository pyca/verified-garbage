# Streaming AES-CMAC: 32-bit ARM implementation

`vg_cmac_aes_init(state = r0, key = r1, key_len = r2, scratch = r3)`,
`vg_cmac_aes_absorb(state = r0, rounds = r1, count = r2:r3, data = [sp], len = [sp, #4], scratch = [sp, #8])`
and `vg_cmac_aes_finish(state = r0, rounds = r1, count = r2:r3, out = [sp], scratch = [sp, #4])`
(see `VG.Spec.Cmac.aesInitContract` and the others), composed of calls of
the verified `vg_aes_expand_key_scratch`, `vg_cmac_aes_subkeys`, `vg_cmac_aes_update`
and `vg_cmac_aes_finalize`, as on x86-64 (`Impl/CmacAes/Stream/X86_64.lean`).

The state (`VG.Spec.Cmac.Repr`) is the key schedule (bytes 0–239), the
subkeys (240–271), the chaining value (272–287) and the bytes held back
(288–303), so bytes 0–271 are `vg_cmac_aes_finalize`'s `key`. The scratch
buffer (2304 bytes): `[0, 2176)` is the working space of the functions
called, and `[2176, 2208)` our caller's callee-saved registers and our
return address `lr`, which every call replaces.

`vg_cmac_aes_update` and `vg_cmac_aes_finalize` take their last two
arguments on the stack: a frame pushes them (`push {rA, rB}`) around each
call, and its pop loads `rA` back. Each uses 8 bytes of stack below that,
so `absorb` and `finish` use 16 bytes of stack, and `init` (whose call of
`vg_cmac_aes_subkeys` takes no stack arguments) 8.

* `init` expands the key into the state, derives the subkeys after it and
  zeroes the chaining value, keeping the state (`r4`), the scratch buffer
  (`r5`) and the rounds (`key_len / 4 + 6`, `r6`) across the calls.
* `absorb` keeps the state (`r4`), the rounds (`r5`), the data (`r6`,
  advancing, with `r7` bytes left), `16 nb` (`r8`) and the scratch buffer
  (`r10`) across the calls, and passes `n` in `r9`. With `h` bytes held back
  (`count` modulo 16, but 16 for a multiple of 16 and 0 for the empty
  message: `((count_lo - 1) & 15) + 1` if `count_lo | count_hi` is not 0),
  it copies `f = min(len, 16 - h)` bytes after them. If data is left (the
  block held back is whole and not the last), it chains that block, then
  the whole blocks of what is left but its last 1 to 16 bytes, which it
  copies to the start of the bytes held back. With no data left, the two
  calls chain no blocks (the second from the state, as the data may then
  end at the end of the address space) and the second copy copies nothing,
  so the code has no branch around a call.
* `finish` copies the chaining value to `out` and calls
  `vg_cmac_aes_finalize` with the state as its key, `out` as its state and
  the `h` bytes held back as the last bytes.

The model has no register-offset addressing: bytes are copied through
advancing pointers, counting down with `subs`, and `min(len, 16 - h)` is
computed with shifts tested by `cmp`. Only the pointers, the key length,
`count` and `len` can affect timing: the branches are on them, and so are
the number of bytes copied and of blocks chained.
