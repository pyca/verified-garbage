# Multiword arithmetic: the layout of the private-key operation

`vg_rsa_private_crt` keeps three workspaces, each with the layout of
`Layout.lean`, in its working space: `n`'s at `scratch`, then `p`'s and
`q`'s, each followed by the 16 entries of its exponentiation's table. These
are the header slots and arrays it uses besides the public-key operation's,
the same on every target.

/-! ## `n`'s header

`n`'s workspace keeps the public-key operation's `sOut`, `sN`, `sK`, `sIn`,
`sMask` and `sCnt`, and the key's pointers and lengths. -/
