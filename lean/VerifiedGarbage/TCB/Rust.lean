# Rendering artifacts as Rust

**Trusted.** Every artifact becomes a Rust naked function whose entire body
is the printed assembly:

```rust
#[unsafe(naked)]
pub(crate) unsafe extern "<abi>" fn <name><sig> {
    core::arch::naked_asm!(
        r"<line>
<line>
…",
    )
}
```

A naked function has no compiler-generated prologue or epilogue, so the
machine code that runs is exactly the code that was verified (plus the
final `ret` from the printer). The functions of each target are collected
in `src/asm/<target>/`, one file per `module`, compiled only under the
target's `cfg`.

A call (`Code.call name body`) is a call instruction whose operand is the
symbol of the Rust function `name` (a `sym` operand). The model runs `body`
for it, so `files` checks that `name` is an artifact of the same target
whose printed code is exactly that of `body`, for every call, including the
calls in `body` itself; otherwise nothing is emitted.

The documentation of each function is its `doc`, with what its contract
requires of the memory each buffer is valid for and of where its buffers are
added to its `# Safety` section (`fullDoc`, `Sig.validDoc`, `Sig.layoutDoc`):
the latter depends on the target's calling convention and on the stack the
code uses, and both are generated from the same signature, calling
convention, `writeArgs` and `stack` as the contract (`Artifact.ofSig`), so
the `doc` must not state them itself (`checkLayout`).

An artifact that reads tables of constants (`Artifact.consts`, and those
its instructions carry, `Printer.tables`: `tablesOf`) names each
by the name of a `static` holding it, which `files` writes once per target,
each in a file of its own, `src/asm/<target>/consts/<name>.rs` (its name in
lowercase), after checking that every artifact of the target with a table of
that name gives the same words and that the code names only its own tables
(`checkConsts`). `consts/mod.rs` declares `Table` and each table's module,
and re-exports its `static`, which the code names as `super::consts::<NAME>`:

```rust
#[repr(C, align(64))]
pub(crate) struct Table<const N: usize>(pub(crate) [u8; N]);

pub(crate) static <NAME>: Table<<8 n>> = Table(*b"\
    <the 8 bytes of word 0, least significant first, as \xHH>\
    …
");
```

A table's file depends on nothing but its name and words, so `EmitOne.lean`
writes those of its artifacts' tables without touching the others.

`Table` holds the bytes of the words at its start (`repr(C)`, one field),
each word little-endian as the contract's memory holds it
(`Abi.constsHeld`), so the static's address is that of word 0. It aligns each table to 64 bytes, a
cache line on every target, so that where a table's entries fall in cache
lines depends only on the table, not on the size of whatever the linker puts
before it (a change to one table would otherwise move the others, and their
functions' timing with them). Its name cannot be a table's (`tableName`).

The code forms a table's address from the static's symbol (a `sym`
operand), on AArch64 by `adrp` and `add` (`Line.sym`), whose operands
`vg_sym_page!` and `vg_sym_pageoff!` (`src/asm/mod.rs`) write in the syntax
of the object format: `<sym>@PAGE` and `<sym>@PAGEOFF` for Mach-O, on
Apple's platforms, and `<sym>` and `:lo12:<sym>` for ELF and COFF; on
x86-64 by `lea` of the RIP-relative operand `[rip + <sym>]`, which is the
same in every object format (`SymPart.ripRel`); on IA-32, by a call to the
next instruction and an ADD of the difference between its return address
and the static (`SymPart.x86PcRel`, the ADD immediate emitted as `.long`
because LLVM's Intel-syntax operand parser rejects symbol differences); on
ARMv7, by `movw` and `movt` of the difference between the static and the
`pc` an `add` then adds (`SymPart.armPcRel`, the same text in ARM and Thumb
code, and position independent; ELF only, as COFF, for Windows' Thumb
targets, cannot represent the difference, so such code does not assemble
there). The
linker resolves them to the static's address, which the model gives
(`State.syms`, fixed for the run as a static's address is) and at which the
contract (`Abi.withConsts`) says the memory holds the table, readable and
apart from every writable region: a `static` is a distinct immutable object.

An artifact whose code needs CPU features beyond the target's baseline
(`Artifact.features`) also gets a last `# Safety` item saying the CPU must
support them, and a constant of them, for the Rust that checks for them
before calling it: a `Features` set (`src/cpu.rs`), made from their names by
`Features::of`, which does not compile with a name `src/cpu.rs` does not
detect:

```rust
/// The CPU features `<name>` requires (`Artifact.features`).
pub(crate) const <NAME>_FEATURES: crate::cpu::Features = crate::cpu::Features::of(&["<feature>", …]);
```

`files` checks that `features` are exactly the features the code requires.
(The functions get no `#[target_feature]` attribute: Rust does not allow one
on naked functions. The x86 assemblers accept every instruction without it;
on AArch64 the printer's `enableFeature`/`disableFeature` directives enable
each feature for the function's body only.) A feature that some of the
target's configurations cannot assemble or must never run has a `cfg`
(`Printer.featureCfg`, ARMv7's `umaal`): the function and its constants are
compiled only under it, `#[cfg(<predicate>)]`.
