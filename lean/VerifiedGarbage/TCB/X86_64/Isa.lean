# x86-64 machine model

**Trusted.** A model of the subset of x86-64 used by our implementations.
Each instruction's semantics here must agree with the Intel SDM; when adding
an instruction, cite the SDM pseudocode it transcribes.

The model is split by instruction family: `State.lean` holds the registers,
the state and memory operands; `Gpr.lean`, `Sse.lean`, `Avx.lean` and
`Avx512.lean` the semantics of the general-purpose, SSE, AVX and AVX-512
instructions; and this file the
instructions themselves, the CPU features they require, and `exec`, which
dispatches to those semantics.

Modelling choices:
* Only 64-bit and 32-bit operand sizes are modelled, plus byte loads
  (`movzx`, zero-extending) and byte stores. SDM Vol. 1 §3.4.1.1: "32-bit
  operands generate a 32-bit result, zero-extended to a 64-bit result in the
  destination general-purpose register."
* Only CF, ZF, SF and OF are modelled. Each is an `Option Bool`; `none` means
  "undefined" (as the SDM specifies for some instructions). Evaluating a
  branch on an undefined flag faults, so verified code never depends on one.
  PF and AF are not modelled, and no modelled instruction reads them.
* Memory accesses must lie within the state's permitted regions: loads within
  `rd ++ wr`, stores within `wr`; otherwise the instruction faults.
* Instructions whose timing depends on their operands (e.g. `div`) must never
  be added: the constant-time leakage model assumes they do not exist. `mul`
  is one of the instructions whose timing Intel documents as independent of
  their data operands ("Data Operand Independent Timing Instruction Set
  Architecture (ISA) Guidance", which lists `MUL`), and so are BMI2's `mulx`
  and ADX's `adcx` and `adox` (it lists `MULX`, `ADCX` and `ADOX`), `shl`
  (`SHL`), the shifts by CL `shl`, `shr` and `sar` (`SHL`, `SHR` and `SAR`,
  each with opcode `0xd3`), BMI2's `shlx` and `shrx` (`SHLX` and `SHRX`; it
  does not list `SARX`, which the model leaves out), `cmovcc` (`CMOVcc`),
  `imul` (`IMUL`, whose opcodes it lists include `0xaf`, the two-operand
  form, and `0x69`, the three-operand form with a 32-bit immediate), `shld`
  (`SHLD`, opcode `0xa4`, by an immediate), `btr` (`BTR`, opcode `0xba`, by
  an immediate), and SSE2's `pcmpeqd` and its VEX forms `vpcmpeqd` (`PCMPEQD`,
  `VPCMPEQD`). `cmovcc` is not a branch: whether the condition holds
  changes the destination, not which instructions run or for how long, so
  the model's leakage of it is only its memory source's address (`addrs`),
  which it reads whether or not the condition holds.
* Assumed, not proven: the model's instructions take a time independent of
  their data operands on every processor that runs this code. Intel's
  guidance, the only vendor statement the model cites, is narrower. It
  covers Intel Core and Atom processors only, not those of other vendors
  (AMD, VIA, Zhaoxin), which document no such list. On Intel Core
  processors from Ice Lake and Intel Atom processors from Gracemont on,
  which enumerate DOITM, it holds only while the DOITM bit
  (IA32_UARCH_MISC_CTL[0], MSR 1B01H) is set; the bit resets to 0 and only
  privileged software can set it, so user code (and so this library)
  cannot, and runs with it clear unless the operating system sets it
  ("Data Operand Independent Timing ISA Guidance", "DOITM";
  https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/best-practices/data-operand-independent-timing-isa-guidance.html).
  And Intel's list of the instructions it covers ("Data Operand Independent
  Timing Instructions", updated 2/23/2026;
  https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/resources/data-operand-independent-timing-instructions.html)
  does not list `VSHA512RNDS2`, `VSHA512MSG1` or `VSHA512MSG2` (`Avx.lean`),
  which take secret data in `vg_sha512_compress_shani`: that they, like
  the `SHA1*` and `SHA256*` instructions it does list, take a time
  independent of their data is an assumption no vendor statement covers.
* Calls (`call`) and returns (`ret`) are near (SDM Vol. 2, "CALL", "RET"),
  direct, or indirect through a register (`callr`, `icall`, the instruction
  of an indirect call, `Code.icall`). The return addresses are the next of
  the state's `unknowns`, which nothing constrains (see `TCB/Code.lean`).
  The function of each name is at the address of its symbol,
  `State.syms name`, as a static is (`ISA.fnAddr`).
* A `static` the code reads (`Artifact.consts`) is at the address
  `State.syms name`, where `name` is its name, which `leaSym` (`lea` of a
  RIP-relative operand, resolved by the linker) puts in a register. No
  instruction changes `syms`: a static's address is fixed for the run of
  the program.
* A table of constants an instruction carries (`aluTbl`, `movdquTbl` and `vmovdquTbl`,
  its name and its words) is the `static` of that name the emitter writes from it
  (`TCB/Rust.lean`), so that for the whole run of the program it is mapped
  readable at `State.syms name` and holds exactly those words, 8 bytes each,
  little-endian, and does not wrap around the address space; and no memory
  any code writes overlaps it: no region a contract lets a function write,
  nor the stack. This is what a Rust `static` without interior mutability
  is: an immutable object, which the linker places in read-only memory,
  apart from every other object and from the stack, and which no `&mut`
  (safe Rust cannot make one to it) nor any other pointer the program may
  write through can reach. So the model reads the words from the
  instruction rather than from `State.mem`, whose writes never reach it,
  and no contract states any of this. Its address, fixed when the program
  is loaded, does not depend on the data the code works on: an access to it
  is observed (`addrs`) as its offset in the table.
* `push` and `pop` (of 64-bit registers other than `rsp`) only occur as the
  push and pop of a frame (see `push`), as a sequence of them. A caller
  passes arguments on the stack by pushing them, the last first, just
  before the call: on the callee's entry the first is then at `[rsp + 8]`,
  above the return address.
* A frame may instead allocate a buffer of `bytes` bytes on the stack
  (`alloc`, `lea rsp, [rsp - bytes]`), released by its pop (`free`, `lea
  rsp, [rsp + bytes]`); `lea` writes only `rsp`, so neither changes the
  flags or memory. `bytes` is positive, a multiple of 8 and less than 4096,
  as for the frames of the AArch64 model: less than a page, so that the
  allocation does not move `rsp` past a guard page below the stack.
* The SSE registers `xmm0`–`xmm15` are modelled as 128 bits each (SDM Vol. 1
  §10.2.2), and separately the upper halves (bits 255:128) of the AVX
  registers `ymm0`–`ymm15` that alias them (SDM Vol. 1 §14.1.1) and bits
  511:256 of the AVX-512 registers `zmm0`–`zmm15` that alias those (SDM
  Vol. 1 §15.5). The legacy SSE instructions leave bits 511:128 unmodified;
  the VEX-encoded ones zero every bit above their vector length (SDM Vol. 1
  §14.1.3: "VEX.128 encoded … the upper bits (MAXVL-1:128) of the
  destination are zeroed", and each VEX.256 form's pseudocode ends with
  `DEST[MAXVL-1:256] := 0`), and so do the EVEX-encoded ones, of 256 or 512
  bits, unmasked (each EVEX form's pseudocode ends with `DEST[MAXVL-1:VL] :=
  0`). Registers `zmm16`–`zmm31`, which only EVEX-encoded instructions name,
  are held in `ymmH` (bits 255:0) and `zmmHiH` (bits 511:256). EVEX.256 and
  EVEX.128 writes zero their upper bits; VZEROUPPER only changes registers
  0–15 (Intel SDM Vol. 2, "VZEROUPPER").
* The opmask registers `k0`–`k7` (SDM Vol. 1, Chapter 15) are not modelled.
  The only masked instructions are the masked 512-bit moves `kLoad` and
  `kStore` (of quadwords) and `kLoad8` and `kStore8` (of bytes), each of
  which the model treats as one instruction together with the `kmovw k1,
  r32` (`kmovq k1, r64` for the bytes) before it that sets its mask, as
  `push` is the sequence of a frame's pushes: no modelled instruction reads `k1`
  otherwise, and only these write it. The value they leave in `k1` is
  never read, and the opmask registers are caller-saved (System V AMD64
  psABI §3.2.1, Figure 3.4: `%k0`–`%k7`, "No" under "callee-saved"), so the
  model need not know it. A masked move accesses exactly the quadwords (or
  bytes) its mask enables: the others are neither read nor written, and may
  be outside the permitted regions, as their faults are suppressed (SDM Vol. 2,
  "MOVDQU,VMOVDQU8/16/32/64", whose EVEX forms have the exceptions of Type
  E4.nb, Vol. 2A §2.8, Table 2-49, which suppress the memory faults of the
  elements whose mask bit is 0). Where an
  access is and which quadwords (or bytes) it enables can affect its timing
  (a masked-off element on an unmapped page may take a microcode assist), so
  it leaks both: its address and the mask, bits 7:0 (bits 63:0 for the
  bytes) of the register it moves to `k1` (`addrs`).
  No SSE, AVX or AVX-512 instruction has a memory operand except the
  unaligned `movdqu`/`vmovdqu`/`vmovdqu32` loads and stores,
  `vbroadcasti128`/`vbroadcasti32x4`, the `vmovdqu64` loads and stores
  (`evLoad`, `evStore`), the quadword source of the
  embedded-broadcast forms `zbcst` (`m64bcst`), the doubleword source of
  `vpbroadcastdZ` (`m32`) and of the embedded-broadcast forms `zbcstd`
  (`m32bcst`), the second source of
  `vbinLoad` (`xmm3/m128` or `ymm3/m256`), the 256-bit second
  source of `vpmadd52Load` and `evMadd52Load` (`m256`), and the masked
  moves `kLoad`, `kStore`, `kLoad8` and `kStore8` (`m512`), which (like
  every VEX or EVEX memory operand but those of the aligned moves) need no alignment, so
  no alignment fault needs modelling.
* MXCSR (SDM Vol. 1 §10.2.3) is modelled as a 32-bit value that only
  `ldmxcsr` and `stmxcsr` access: no other modelled instruction reads or
  writes it (integer instructions raise no SIMD floating-point exceptions).
  Its control bits (15:6) are callee-saved (see `Target.lean`). `lfence`
  has no architectural effect, so the model treats it as a no-op. As in
  the SDM, bits 31:16 are reserved: `ldmxcsr` of a value with any of them
  set faults. AMD processors with misaligned SSE mode define bit 17 as the
  control bit MM, "Misaligned Exception Mask" (AMD64 Architecture
  Programmer's Manual Vol. 1, "MXCSR Register"), which the model does not
  know, so code that saves and restores MXCSR clears bits 31:16 of the
  value it restores (`and r32, 65535`): a caller's MM = 1 would be cleared
  on return. Nothing is known to set it.
* MXCSR-configuration-dependent timing (MCDT): on some Intel processors,
  the multiplies of the model but `mul` and `mulx` (`pmuludq`, `vpmuludq`,
  `pmullw`, `vpmullw`, `pmulhw`, `vpmulhw`, `pmaddwd`, `vpmaddwd`,
  `pmulhrsw`, `vpmulhrsw`,
  `vpmadd52luq` and `vpmadd52huq`), although on Intel's DOIT
  list, may take up to a cycle longer to retire for specific data values
  unless MXCSR holds `0x1FBF` (Intel, "MXCSR Configuration Dependent Timing", and
  its list of the instructions affected, "MCDT Data Operand Independent
  Timing Instructions"; the processors that enumerate `MCDT_NO`,
  CPUID.(EAX=7H,ECX=2):EDX[5], are not affected). The leakage model does
  not see this, so code must only give these instructions secret operands
  between Intel's prologue and epilogue:
  `stmxcsr` (save the caller's MXCSR), `ldmxcsr` of `0x1FBF`, `lfence`, then
  the code that uses them, then `lfence` and `ldmxcsr` of the saved value.
  `ci/check_mcdt.py` checks this in the generated code; `lfence` and the
  MXCSR instructions exist in the model for it.

Address", with a 64-bit operand size and address size: `DEST :=
EffectiveAddress(SRC)`, the address computed modulo 2⁶⁴; "Flags Affected:
None". The `bytes` bytes below `rsp` become a writable region, at the head
of `wr`, which it does not write: they hold what memory held there, as the
bytes a call or a push stores below `rsp` before it does (and a contract
says nothing of them: they are in the stack below the caller's stack
pointer, `Abi.reserved`). Faults unless `0 < bytes < 4096` and `bytes` is a
multiple of 8, or if the frame would wrap around the address space. -/

last quadword of the frame. Faults if `k = 0` or `r` is `rsp`, and unless
`rsp` and the writable regions are those the push left (`s₁`), and the
frame, the region at their head, has `8 * k` bytes; it removes the frame.

Or `lea rsp, [rsp + bytes]` (`free`, "LEA" as for `alloc`), with the same
conditions on `bytes` as `alloc` and on `rsp` and the writable regions as
`pop`, the frame having `bytes` bytes; it changes neither memory nor any
