# The x86-64 System V target

**Trusted.** Functions are emitted as Rust `extern "sysv64"` naked functions.

System V AMD64 ABI: integer/pointer arguments arrive in `rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx,
r8, r9`; the integer result is returned in `rax`; `rbx, rbp, rsp, r12–r15` are
callee-saved. The return address is at `[rsp]` on entry; the printer ends
every function with `ret`, so `abiPreserved` demands that `rsp` and the
return-address slot are unchanged on exit.

The SSE registers `xmm0`–`xmm15` are all caller-saved (System V AMD64
psABI §3.2.1, Figure 3.4: "No" under "callee-saved"; also on Windows, whose
own convention the functions do not use), and so are the upper halves of
the `ymm` registers that contain them and `zmm16`–`zmm31` (the psABI makes
no vector register callee-saved), so `abiPreserved` says nothing about them.

The control bits of MXCSR (15:6; bits 5:0 are the status flags, SDM Vol. 1
§10.2.3) are callee-saved: "The control bits of the MXCSR register are
callee-saved (preserved across calls), while the status bits are
caller-saved (not preserved)" (System V AMD64 psABI §3.4.1, "Special
Registers").

Not modelled: the direction flag (no modelled instruction changes it; it is
clear on entry and exit), the x87 control word (never modified), and the
red zone: a contract that grants write access below `rsp` must keep it within
the 128-byte red zone.

/-! ## The calling convention, for `Sig`

Each integer or pointer argument takes the next of `rdi, rsi,
rdx, rcx, r8, r9` (a 32-bit argument in the low half; the upper half is
unspecified). Once they are used up, each further argument takes the next
eightbyte on the stack, in order, the first at `[rsp + 8]` on entry, just
above the return address at `[rsp]`. System V AMD64 psABI §3.2.3,
"Parameter Passing": for class INTEGER "the next available register of the
sequence %rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %rcx, %r8 and %r9 is used"; "if there are no
registers available for any eightbyte of an argument, the whole argument is
passed on the stack", the arguments passed in memory being "pushed on the
stack in reversed (right-to-left) order"; Figure 3.3, "Stack Frame with Base
Pointer": `8n+16(%rbp)` holds "memory argument eightbyte n", which is
`8n+8(%rsp)` on entry, before the callee pushes `rbp`. A 32-bit argument is
in the low half of its eightbyte; the upper half is unspecified. `abi` only
grants reading the stack arguments, and assumes they do not wrap around the
end of the address space, nor the stack below `rsp` that the function's calls
and frames use (a frame's push faults if it would wrap: `Isa.lean`). The
integer result is in `rax`.
