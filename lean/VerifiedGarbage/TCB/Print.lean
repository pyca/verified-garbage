# Lowering structured code to assembly text

**Trusted.** Structured control flow is lowered to local labels and
conditional branches:

* `ite c t e`  ⟶  `b<c> Lthen; e; b Lend; Lthen: t; Lend:`
* `loop body c` ⟶  `Ltop: body; b<c> Ltop`
* `call name body` ⟶  `<call> name` (the call instruction, e.g. `call` or
  `bl`, of the function `name`, which is emitted separately: see
  `VG.Rust.files`)
* an instruction naming a `static` (`Printer.symLines`) ⟶ lines with the
  page of its address or the offset in that page (`Line.sym`), which
  `VG.Rust.files` writes in the syntax of the object format
* `frame push body pop` ⟶  `push; body; pop`
* `icall i name body next` ⟶  `i` (the indirect call instruction, e.g.
  `call r11`; the functions it may call, `name` and those of `next`, are
  emitted separately, as `call`'s)

where `b<c> L` is the conditional branch to `L`, which on some targets is
more than one instruction (e.g. a comparison, then the branch).

Structured-control-flow labels are numeric local labels (`N:`, referenced
as `Nf` forward or `Nb` backward), the only kind Rust allows in inline
assembly (the `named_asm_labels` lint). Each has a distinct number, so each
reference has exactly one target. The numbers are `20`, `21`, `22`, …
(`2` followed by a counter): a number of only `0`s and `1`s could be read as a
binary literal in Intel syntax.
IA-32's `symPush` reserves label `2` for its adjacent call/address pair;
its references use the nearest `2f`/`2b`, even with several such pairs.
ARMv7's `adrSym` likewise reserves labels `2` and `3`, around its `add`,
which its `movw` and `movt` reference as the nearest `2f` and `3f`.

A printer's `funcAlign` is an assembler alignment directive (e.g.
`.p2align 6`) that `VG.Rust.function` emits after everything else in the
function, so that where the function's code lies relative to the processor's
fetch blocks and decoded-instruction cache lines depends on the function
alone, not on the size of the code the linker happens to place before it.
The directive raises the alignment of the function's section, so the
function's first instruction lies on the boundary (`naked_asm!` gives each
function a section of its own on ELF and COFF targets). Whatever padding the
assembler inserts at the directive comes after the return that ends the
function (`Printer.function`), so it is never executed: the printed code is
the same instructions, at the same distances from one another.

A cold branch (`Code.iteCold c t e`, an `ite` whose `then` branch is
marked by two empty blocks) is laid out out of line: `if c` branches to
`t`'s code after the function's return, `e` falls through to the code after
the `ite`, and `t`'s code ends with a jump back to it. So the instructions
of the code around the `ite` and of `e`, which the hot path runs, are the
same, at the same addresses, whatever `t` is. The cold code comes before the
`funcAlign` directives. The printer keys on exactly that shape: a `then`
branch `.seq (.seq (.block []) (.block [])) t` is reserved for cold branches
(`Emit.lean --check` shows no other code has it).

Together with each ISA's instruction printer this is part of the trusted
base; it is small enough to check by inspection and is covered by the golden
tests in `VerifiedGarbageTest/Print.lean`.
