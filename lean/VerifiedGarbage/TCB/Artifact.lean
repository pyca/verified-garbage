# Targets, contracts and verified artifacts

**Trusted.** This file defines what it *means* for an emitted function to be
verified. Every function the Rust crate contains is an `Artifact`, and an
`Artifact` cannot be constructed without a proof of `Verified`.

`Verified T c k` says, for the machine code `c` on target `T` and contract `k`:

1. **Total correctness and memory safety.** From every state satisfying
   `k.pre`, `c` terminates without faulting (so every memory access stays in
   the regions the state permits) in a state related to the initial one by
   `k.post` *and* by the target's calling-convention obligations
   `T.abiPreserved` (callee-saved registers, stack pointer, return address).
2. **Constant time.** Any two runs from `k.pre`-states that agree on public
   data (`k.pub`) have identical leakage traces (addresses and branches).
   Public data is the pointers, lengths and public integer arguments, plus
   anything the contract declares the function may leak (`Sig.contract`'s
   `leak`): the traces may depend on that, and on nothing else secret.
3. **Non-vacuity.** Some state satisfies `k.pre`. This is only a sanity
   check against an accidentally contradictory precondition; it does not
   replace reviewing the contract.

What a reviewer must read for each artifact is therefore: the ISA model and
ABI of its target (`TCB/<arch>/`), its contract (in `Spec/`), and its Rust
signature (`Sig`) and documentation (its `Api` in `Spec/`, and what its
registration file adds for the target). The code and the proof need not be
read.

namespace VG

/-- A code-generation target: an ISA model, its printer, and its calling convention. -/
structure Target where
  /-- Short name; also the name of the generated Rust module (e.g. `x86_64`). -/
  name : String
  isa : ISA
  printer : Printer isa
  /-- Calling-convention obligations every function must meet when it
  returns, relating the entry state to the exit state (callee-saved
  registers and the stack pointer restored, return address intact). -/
  abiPreserved : isa.State → isa.State → Prop
  /-- The Rust `cfg` predicate under which this target's functions are
  compiled. It must exclude every configuration of the architecture that the
  model does not describe: memory is little-endian in every ISA model
  (`TCB/Mem.lean`), and pointers have `abi`'s width (`Abi.ptrBits`), which
  the contracts assume. -/
  rustCfg : String
  /-- The Rust ABI string of the generated functions (e.g. `sysv64`). -/
  rustAbi : String
  /-- The calling convention that `rustAbi` stands for. -/
  abi : Abi isa
  /-- What returning without secret residue means for a function with
  signature `sig` whose calls and frames use `stack` bytes of stack
  (`Artifact.clearsResidue`), relating the entry state to the exit state;
  `False` on a target that does not define it. -/
  noResidue : Sig → Nat → isa.State → isa.State → Prop := fun _ _ _ _ => False

/-- The specification of one function. -/
structure Contract (M : ISA) where
  /-- Precondition on the entry state: argument registers, permitted memory
  regions, disjointness, CPU features, … -/
  pre : M.State → Prop
  /-- Postcondition relating the entry state to the exit state. -/
  post : M.State → M.State → Prop
  /-- When two entry states agree on everything public (e.g. lengths and
  pointers, but not keys or plaintexts). -/
  pub : M.State → M.State → Prop

/-- The contract of a function with signature `sig` under the calling
convention `A`: the obligations the signature implies (see `TCB/Sig.lean`),
the further precondition `pre` and the postcondition `post`, both stated on
the arguments by name. If `writeArgs`, the function may also overwrite its
arguments passed in memory, where the calling convention gives them to the
callee; otherwise it may only read them. `stack` is the number of bytes of
stack below the stack pointer that the function's calls and frames use
(return addresses, arguments and saved registers), which no buffer
overlaps. A calling convention that does not model the arguments (`A.args`
is `none`) gives an unsatisfiable precondition, which `Verified` rejects.
Only the bits of a public argument's own width are public: a 32-bit argument
in a 64-bit register leaves the upper half unspecified (whatever the caller
left there, which may be secret), so two runs need not agree on it.

A list of slices (`Param.slices`) adds read-only memory that depends on the
memory on entry: its descriptors, and the slices they list (`Sig.lists`),
which may overlap each other and the other read-only buffers, but no
writable buffer (a `&[&[T]]` and a `&mut` are distinct Rust objects). What
its descriptors say is public (`Sig.descs`): two runs agree on their bytes.

`leak`, if given, declares what the function may leak beyond its public
arguments: a list of numbers computed from the arguments and the memory on
entry (e.g. the sequence of table indices an algorithm reads, when the
algorithm itself makes them depend on secrets). It is added to the public
data, so two runs need identical leakage traces only if they agree on it:
the function may reveal it through its timing, and nothing else secret.
Every contract without `leak` is constant time in the usual sense. -/

/-! ## Documenting the obligations `Sig.contract` implies

The emitter adds to each function's `# Safety` section what `Sig.contract`
requires of the memory each buffer is valid for (`Sig.validDoc`) and of where
its buffers are (`Sig.layoutDoc`), and a note if it may overwrite its
arguments (`Sig.layoutNote`), from the same signature, calling convention,
`writeArgs` and `stack` as its contract (`Artifact.ofSig`). The
calling convention names its argument area and reserved memory
(`Abi.argAreaDoc`, `Abi.reservedDoc`).

target (`{ api with target := …, doc := api.doc, … }`), adding any notes on
the implementation; the emitter adds the obligations the signature implies
(`Sig.validDoc`, and `Sig.layoutDoc`, which depends on the target).

The `Artifact` takes `contracts` from the `Api` with its name and signature,
and must be proven against `contracts` on its target (`Artifact.ofApi`): so
the Rust name, signature and documentation that `Spec/` gives a function are
