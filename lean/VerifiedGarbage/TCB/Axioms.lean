# Axiom audit

**Trusted.** `#assert_standard_axioms c` fails unless the constant `c` (and so
everything it depends on, transitively) uses only Lean's three standard
axioms. In particular this rejects `sorry` (`sorryAx`) and anything proven by
`native_decide`/`bv_decide`, which add an auxiliary axiom asserting the
result of compiled code and thus trust the compiler. It refuses to run in a
module, which sees the theorems it imports without their proofs.
