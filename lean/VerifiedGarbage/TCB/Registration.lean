# Registering an implementation of an `Api`

**Trusted.** A registration file makes each function's `Artifact` from its
`Api` with `Api.artifact`, stating only what the implementation chooses: the
target, the code and its proof, the stack it uses, the constant tables it
reads, the CPU features it needs, how much of its writable arrays it writes
(`written`, with its proof), and any notes on it and the suffix of its
name. Everything else comes from the `Api` (`Spec/`): the Rust module, name,
signature and documentation, `writeArgs`, and the contract on the target,
which the proof is of. So of a registration, a reviewer reads `suffix`,
`notes` and `features` (which the emitter checks against the code); the
kernel checks the rest, `written` included.
