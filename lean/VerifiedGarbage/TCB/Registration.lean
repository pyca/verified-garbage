# Registering an implementation of an `Api`

**Trusted.** A registration file makes each function's `Artifact` from its
`Api` with `Api.artifact`, stating only what the implementation chooses: the
target, the code and its proof, the stack it uses, the constant tables it
reads, the tables of functions it takes, the CPU features it needs, how much
of its writable arrays it writes (`written`, with its proof), and the suffix
of its name. Everything else
comes from the `Api` (`Spec/`): the Rust module, name, signature and
documentation, `writeArgs`, and the contract on the target, which the proof
is of. So of a registration, a reviewer reads `suffix` and
`features` (which the emitter checks against the code); the kernel checks
the rest, `written` included.
