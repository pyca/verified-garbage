# The emitter

**Trusted.** What `Emit.lean` runs: which artifacts are emitted, and how the
generated files are written or checked.

The artifacts emitted are those of every *registration file*: each `.lean` file under `VerifiedGarbage/Artifacts/`,
say `VerifiedGarbage/Artifacts/Sha3/X86_64.lean`, must define the list
`VG.Artifacts.Sha3.X86_64.artifacts : List Artifact`. Adding functions for
an algorithm or a target adds such a file, so that parallel changes don't
all edit one list.

## Variants and generic callers

Some functions have several implementations with the same contract (e.g. a
compression function in scalar code and with the SHA extensions), and other
functions call them. A caller whose proof holds for any implementation is
*generic*: it is emitted once for each implementation, each a direct call
of that implementation. Adding an implementation must not edit its callers,
so both are found by their files:

* a *variant* file, `VerifiedGarbage/Variants/<Iface>/<Target>/<Name>.lean`,
  defines `VG.Variants.<Iface>.<Target>.<Name>.variant`, one implementation
  of the interface `<Iface>` on `<Target>`;
* a *generic* file, `VerifiedGarbage/Generic/<Iface>/<Target>/<Alg>.lean`,
  defines `VG.Generic.<Iface>.<Target>.<Alg>.artifacts`, a function from a
  variant of `<Iface>` on `<Target>` to a list of artifacts.

A caller of functions of several interfaces (e.g. a key derivation calling
both a hash's compression function and a block function, each with its own
implementations) is generic over all of them: its file is
`VerifiedGarbage/Generic/<Iface₁>/…/<Ifaceₙ>/<Target>/<Alg>.lean`, and its
`artifacts` takes a variant of each interface on `<Target>`, in that order.
Variants of different interfaces may have the same suffix (e.g. `_avx2`), so
the instances of such a caller are named by `qualifiedName`: its name, then
for each interface whose variant has a non-empty suffix, in that order, a tag
for the interface and the suffix (`vg_argon2_blake2b_avx2_g_avx512`;
the instance of the baseline variants keeps the plain name, `vg_argon2`).
Callers of one interface append the suffix alone (`vg_sha256_update_shani`).

The artifacts emitted include each generic function applied to each variant
of its interface and target (each combination of a variant of each of its
interfaces), in order of their module names. What a variant is (its type)
is up to the interface, as long as every variant and every generic function
of it agree, which elaboration checks. Nothing here needs trusting beyond
the files found: every artifact carries its own proof, and
the emitter checks its calls and features (`Rust.files`) as for any other.
A variant's own functions (e.g. the implementation itself) are listed in a
registration file as usual.

`Emit.lean` finds the registration, variant and generic files
(`registrations`, `grouped`, `genericGroups`), writes a program that
imports them all, checks that the whole list depends only on the standard
axioms, that what it runs is what the kernel checked and that the `Spec/`
names it uses come from `Spec/` (`TCB/Audit.lean`), and emits it
(`driver`), and runs that program, whose `main` is `run`.
