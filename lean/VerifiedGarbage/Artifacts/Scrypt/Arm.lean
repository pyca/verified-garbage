# scrypt (RFC 7914): Salsa20/8, scryptBlockMix, scryptROMix and scrypt on 32-bit ARM

`vg_scrypt` calls `vg_pbkdf2_hmac_sha256_scratch` (registered in
`Artifacts/Pbkdf2Sha256/Arm.lean`), the one implementation of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
on this target, and `vg_scrypt_romix`. Its `stack` is the 40 bytes the frame
of PBKDF2's stack arguments and PBKDF2's own frames use.
