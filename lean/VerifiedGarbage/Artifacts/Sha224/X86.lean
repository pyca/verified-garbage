# SHA-224 (FIPS 180-4) on x86 (32-bit)

SHA-224 is SHA-256 from another initial hash value, and its digest the first
28 bytes of the final hash value: its `init` is registered here, its
`update` is SHA-256's (`Artifacts/Sha256/`), and its `finalize`, which
writes its digest, is emitted with each compression function
(`Variants/Sha256/X86/`).
