# Ed25519 signing with a cached public key

**Trusted** (as every file in `Spec/`). RFC 8032 §5.1.6 uses the public key
`A` derived in §5.1.5. A caller may retain that key instead of deriving it
again for every signature. This contract requires that correspondence
explicitly and retains the complete `sign seed message` postcondition,
including every SHA-512 invocation. It does not specify a signature for
an independently chosen seed/public-key pair.

The seed-only `signContract` remains available unchanged. This additional
entry point lets `SigningKey`, which stores a seed and its derived public
key together, call one verified signing operation without repeating the
public-key scalar multiplication. No buffer contents may affect timing,
including the cached public key.
