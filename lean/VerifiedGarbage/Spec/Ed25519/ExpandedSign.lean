# Ed25519 signing with a cached expanded secret and public key

**Trusted** (as every file in `Spec/`). RFC 8032 §5.1.6, step 1 hashes the
seed with SHA-512 for every signature; the digest depends on the seed alone.
A caller may retain that 64-byte digest (the input to `expandSecret`: the
secret scalar's bytes, then the nonce prefix) together with the public key
derived in §5.1.5, rather than computing them again for each signature, as
`signCachedContract` (`CachedSign.lean`) already lets it retain the public
key. This contract requires both correspondences explicitly: some seed
must have the digest at `expanded` and the public key at `pk`. It retains
the complete `sign seed message` postcondition for every such seed: the
signature is the one RFC 8032 specifies for the seed. It does not specify
a signature for an expanded secret or a public key chosen independently
of a seed.

The seed itself is not a parameter: a signature depends on the seed only
through its SHA-512 digest, which keeps the arguments in registers on
every target. `signCachedContract` remains available unchanged. No buffer contents may affect timing, including the cached
digest and public key.
