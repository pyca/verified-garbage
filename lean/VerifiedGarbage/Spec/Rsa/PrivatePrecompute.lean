# RSA private keys' precomputed values

**Trusted** (as every file in `Spec/`). `vg_rsa_private_precompute`, in the
module `rsa`: the values of a private key's modulus and factors that the
private-key operations need and that do not depend on their input
(`privatePrecompute`), so that they are computed once, when the key is
loaded, and kept with the key, rather than at every operation.

The values are the modulus' (`publicPrecompute`: `n` and `R² mod n`, which
the check of each result against `e` needs), then `R_p² mod p` for the
Montgomery radix `R_p = 2^(64 w_p)` of `p`'s `w_p = max(2, ⌈p_len / 8⌉)`
words of 64 bits (`primeWords`, `primeR2`), and the same for `q`. The
operations given them (`vg_rsa_pss_sign_precomputed`,
`vg_rsa_pkcs1_sign_precomputed`, `vg_rsa_oaep_decrypt_precomputed`,
`vg_rsa_pkcs1_decrypt_precomputed`, in their padding schemes' files) compute
what the same operations without them compute, if they are given what
`vg_rsa_private_precompute` wrote for their key; an implementation uses
those of the values it needs, and may ignore the others.

Numbers are as in `Spec/Rsa/Contract.lean`. The modulus `n`, and so its
values, are public; `p` and `q`, and so `R_p² mod p` and `R_q² mod q`, are
secret.

octets: `max(2, ⌈len / 8⌉)`. -/

first. -/

of the modulus `nB` (`k` octets): `publicPrecompute nB`, then `primeR2 pB`
and `primeR2 qB`; or `none` if the modulus is not valid. -/

factors of `pLen` and `qLen`. -/
