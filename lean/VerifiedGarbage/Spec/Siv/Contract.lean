# AES-SIV: the contracts, on every target

**Trusted** (as every file in `Spec/`). The contracts of AES-SIV, in terms of
`Spec/Siv.lean`, for any target: `A` is the target's calling convention.
The signatures fix where the arguments are, the memory each function may
access, disjointness, and that the pointers, the lengths and the number of
rounds are public (see `TCB/Sig.lean`); the contracts add the rest.
Everything else (keys, key contexts, S2V states, associated data, texts and
synthetic IVs) is secret.

The associated data of SIV is a vector of strings (RFC 5297 §2.6; for
nonce-based encryption the nonce is its last component, §3), which S2V
absorbs one component at a time (§2.4), so the functions are S2V's steps:

* `vg_aes_siv_init` writes a key context (`KeyRepr`): the key schedule of
  `K1`, its CMAC subkeys and the key schedule of `K2`. The others read one,
  with its number of rounds, and compute with the CMAC and the cipher it
  holds (`ctxMac`, `ctxCiph`): with a context `vg_aes_siv_init` wrote, that
  is AES-SIV with its key (`ctxMac_eq`, `ctxCiph_eq`).
* `vg_aes_siv_s2v_start` starts S2V's state `D` (`s2vStart`), and
  `vg_aes_siv_s2v_ad` absorbs one component of associated data into it
  (`s2vStep`): after `s2v_start` and `s2v_ad` of `AD1, …, ADn` in order, `D`
  is `s2vAcc` of them.
* `vg_aes_siv_seal` finishes S2V with the plaintext and encrypts it in place
  (`sealWith`), writing the synthetic IV `V`; from the state of `AD1, …, ADn`,
  that is `SIV-ENCRYPT` (`encryptWith_eq`).
* `vg_aes_siv_open` decrypts the ciphertext in place with the synthetic IV
  it is given, finishes S2V with the plaintext and compares (`openWith`),
  and if they differ overwrites the plaintext with zeros, so that it is
  never released; from the state of `AD1, …, ADn`, that is `SIV-DECRYPT`
  (`decryptWith_eq`). Whether `V` is right is public: `open` may leak it (it
  is the result), and nothing else secret.

`vg_aes_siv_encrypt` and `vg_aes_siv_decrypt` are the whole of
`SIV-ENCRYPT` and `SIV-DECRYPT` (`encryptWith`, `decryptWith`) in one call:
they take the vector of associated data as a list of slices (`Param.slices`,
read by `components`), and run S2V over it themselves. `decrypt` overwrites
the plaintext with zeros if `V` is wrong, and may leak whether it is.

The functions check no length; the RFC limits the associated data to 126
components (§7), which the caller counts. The synthetic IV travels in the
first 16 bytes of `work`, which is also working space, so that fewer
arguments are passed in memory. Each function's working space (`scratch` or
`work`) has room for `vg_aes_ctr32`'s (2048 bytes) and 512 bytes more, and
`encrypt`'s and `decrypt`'s 16 more, for S2V's state.

Every contract takes the number of bytes of stack below the stack pointer
that an implementation's calls and frames use (`stack`, see `Sig.contract`),
0 for one that uses none; the functions may overwrite their arguments passed
in memory, where the calling convention allows it (`writeArgs`), to pass
arguments to the functions they call.
