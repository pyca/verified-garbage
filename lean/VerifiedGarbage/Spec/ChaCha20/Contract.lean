# ChaCha20: the contracts, on every target

**Trusted** (as every file in `Spec/`). The contracts of ChaCha20's
streaming functions, in terms of `Spec/ChaCha20.lean`, for any target: `A`
is the target's calling convention. The signatures fix where the arguments
are, the memory each function may access, disjointness, and that the
pointers and lengths are public (see `TCB/Sig.lean`).

`vg_chacha20_init`, `vg_chacha20_set_nonce` and `vg_chacha20_apply` are the
cipher with the 16-byte nonce of `keystreamOf` (the initial block counter
and the RFC 8439 nonce), applied in pieces of any length, on a streaming
state (see `keyAt`, `leftAt`, `restAt`) that holds the key, the position in
the keystream and a partly used block. `init` makes the state represent the
whole keystream of a key and nonce, `set_nonce` that of another nonce with
the same key, and `apply` XORs the next bytes of it into data, or, if fewer
are left (the block counter would pass 2³² − 1), returns 0 and changes
nothing: so the caller keeps no count of its own.

The key, the nonce, the keystream and the data are secret. The number of
bytes of keystream left (`leftAt`) is not: `apply` may leak it (`leak`),
which an implementation needs to branch on the position within a block and
to check the length. It is 64 × (2³² − c) less the bytes applied since the
nonce was set, so it reveals the initial block counter `c` and the total
length applied: in RFC 8439 the block counter is public, as the nonce is
(§2.8 sends the nonce with the ciphertext and starts the counter at 1), and
the lengths of the pieces are public as every length is.

The streaming functions take the number of bytes of stack below the stack
pointer that an implementation's calls and frames use (`stack`), and
`apply` may overwrite its arguments passed in memory (`writeArgs`), to pass
arguments to the functions it calls. Its implementations
for CPU features (e.g. `vg_chacha20_apply_avx2`) have the same contract.
