# X25519: the contract, on every target

**Trusted** (as every file in `Spec/`). The contract of `vg_x25519`, in
terms of `Spec/X25519.lean`, for any target: `A` is the target's calling
convention. The signature fixes where the arguments are, the memory the
function may access, disjointness, and that the pointers are public (see
`TCB/Sig.lean`); the contract adds the rest. The scalar and the
u-coordinate are secret (the u-coordinate is usually a public key, but the
function does not rely on it).

The function takes 4 KiB of working space (`scratch`), which it leaves
unspecified, since the ladder's variables do not fit in the registers of any
target.

`vg_x25519` supports both public-key derivation using the base point and key
exchange using a peer's public key. `vg_x25519_base` computes the first alone,
`X25519(k, 9)`, with the same postcondition as `vg_x25519` with `point` the
base point (`basePoint`), so that an implementation can compute it otherwise
than with the ladder (e.g. as the u-coordinate `(1 + y) / (1 - y)` of a
fixed-base multiplication on edwards25519, RFC 7748 §4.1). It takes 8 KiB of
working space, as Ed25519's fixed-base multiplication does.

The contract takes the number of bytes of stack below the stack pointer that
an implementation's calls and frames use (`stack`, see `Sig.contract`), 0
for one that uses none.
