# Constant-time comparison of byte strings

**Trusted** (as every file in `Spec/`). Not a cryptographic algorithm: the
comparison of two byte strings that a MAC's or an AEAD's verification makes
between a received tag and the one it computes, which must not reveal
through its timing where the two first differ (else a forger can find a
valid tag a byte at a time).

The function's result is the only thing that may depend on the bytes: its
contract (`Spec/Ct/Contract.lean`) says what it returns, and, as every
contract without `leak`, that its timing depends only on its public
arguments, the pointers and the lengths.

This file is independent of any architecture; the contract on every target
is in `Spec/Ct/Contract.lean`.
