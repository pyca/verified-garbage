# Golden tests for the documented obligations of signatures

`Sig.validDoc`, `Sig.layoutDoc` and `Sig.layoutNote` write, into every
function's `# Safety` section, what `Sig.contract` requires of the memory each
buffer is valid for and of where its buffers are, which depends on the
target's calling convention (`Abi.argAreaDoc`, `Abi.reservedDoc`) and on the
stack the function uses. These tests pin down the text on each target.
