"""Chooses which architectures' benchmarks a change needs.

    git diff --name-only BASE HEAD | python3 ci/bench_arches.py
    python3 ci/bench_arches.py --all

Prints a JSON list of platforms (see `PLATFORMS`) for the Benchmarks
workflow's matrix: an architecture is benchmarked when its own assembly
(`src/asm/<arch>/`) changed, or anything shared by every architecture (the
rest of `src/`, the benchmarks, the dependencies, the comparison). Changes
to other files (e.g. Lean that leaves `src/asm/` as it was) need none.

Each platform's `modules` narrows its benchmarks to the modules whose own
files changed:

  * `src/asm/<arch>/<module>.rs`: `<module>`, on that architecture;
  * `src/<module>.rs` or `src/hashes/<module>.rs`: `<module>`, and
    `src/hashes/mod.rs` (`streaming_hash!`, `HashFunction`): every hash
    module in `src/hashes/` (benchmarks of code built on a hash, such as
    HMAC, list that hash in their `USES`);
  * `src/<family>/<hash>.rs`: `<family>_<hash>` (as in `src/asm/`), and
    `src/<family>/mod.rs`: every `<family>_<hash>`;
  * a private module of the crate, `src/<helper>.rs` (`mod <helper>;` in
    `src/lib.rs`, used by none of the benchmarks, e.g. `ct`): the modules
    whose code names `crate::<helper>`;
  * a module only tests compile (`#[cfg(test)] mod <name>;`): none;
  * `bench/benches/primitives/<name>.rs`, or its differential test
    `bench/tests/<name>.rs`: the modules in its `USES`, or for a helper
    without one (e.g. `mlkem.rs`, a macro), those of the benchmarks that
    call it.

The benchmarks run those that use any of them, and all of them for a module
none uses (e.g. `lib`, or the generated `src/asm/<arch>/mod.rs`). Any
other shared change (e.g. executable code in benchmarks' `main.rs`, or a benchmark whose
`USES` cannot be read) leaves `modules` empty, which runs every benchmark.

A change to `src/cpu.rs` needs, on each architecture, the modules that
choose among implementations by a feature whose detection changed there:
the first feature each changed line names (the one it detects, as in
`let vaes = (ecx7 >> 9) & avx;`), in an item only one architecture (or a
few) compiles, such as its `runtime()`, or all its features if those lines
name none. A change to an item every architecture compiles (`Features`,
`detected()`) needs every module that chooses by a feature, on the
architectures detecting any; one to its tests, its comments or the names
appended to `NAMES` needs nothing. Its other code (choosing an
implementation once, when an object is created) is the same everywhere, so
measuring it where something is chosen suffices.

An architecture with primitives that choose among implementations by CPU
feature is benchmarked once with every feature the runner has, and once
more for each restriction in `CPU_FEATURES` (as `VG_CPU_FEATURES`, see
src/cpu.rs), so that every implementation is measured. Each entry's
`cpu-features` is its restriction, empty for none. With `--base REV`, edits
consisting only of module/benchmark registrations select their dependencies.

With a `BENCHMARKS_PER_JOB`, each configuration is split into jobs of at most
that many of the benchmarks it runs (`shard` is `i/n`, empty for one):
`bench_compare.py --shard` runs that share of them.

When only some benchmarks run, a configuration runs only if it can choose
other implementations of them than the configurations before it: one that
allows the same of the feature sets they choose by is left out. A benchmark
chooses by the features of each of its `USES` modules' generated variants
(a `_FEATURES` constant of `src/asm/<arch>/<module>.rs`) and by each feature
its architecture detects that their Rust code names in quotes (e.g.
`chacha20`'s `"neon"`), at base and at head. A module whose Rust code reads `VG_CPU_FEATURES` itself (on
AArch64, SHA-3 uses FEAT_SHA3 only when it is named) depends on which of its
features each configuration names. All benchmarks run every configuration.
