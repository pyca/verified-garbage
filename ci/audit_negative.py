"""Checks that the axiom audit rejects an axiom hidden in a Lean module, and
that the audits refuse to run in one.

A module sees the theorems it imports from other modules as axioms, without
their proofs, so the audits run in the emitter's driver, a file that is not
a module, which sees every proof (`TCB/Axioms.lean`). This test proves that
they still see through modules, and through a private import, which hides a
module from the modules that import the importer, but not from a file that is
not a module. It adds `axiom vg_bad : False` and a theorem proven from it to a
module that an artifact depends on (`Spec/Selftest.lean`), and adds a module
with another such axiom, `Proof/Selftest/AuditPrivate.lean`, which the
self-test's proof imports with a plain `import`. It proves `add_correct` from
both theorems, and checks that `EmitOne.lean --check Selftest.X86_64` fails
with the audit's `depends on non-standard axioms: [...]`, listing both
`VG.Spec.Selftest.vg_bad` and `VG.Proof.Selftest.AuditPrivate.vg_bad`: the
audit lists every axiom it finds, so one build checks both ways of hiding one.
It checks the same of `Emit.lean --check`, which relies on the audit
`VGEmit.Audit.X86_64` that `lake build` built before the edits (see "Drivers
as modules" in `TCB/Emit.lean`): `EmitOne.lean` has built the self-test's
modules again from the edited files, but not that audit, so the X86-64
program must find its audit stale (`STALE`) and emit nothing, and
`Emit.lean` must then build the audit, which Lake rebuilds as a proof
behind a private import changed, and which rejects both axioms.

It edits the files in place, after copying them to a temporary directory,
and restores them from there (and deletes the module it added) whatever
happens, then checks with `git diff` and `git status` that the tree is as it
was: the axiom never reaches the tree that is committed.

It also runs every audit command in a scratch module, outside the tree,
while the self-test builds, and checks that each refuses to run there (Lean
reports each command's error and goes on to the next).

Run it from the repository root after a full build (CI runs it
last in the job that assembles the build, after that build is saved): it
rebuilds the few modules of the self-test that the edits change, and leaves
them built from the edited files.
