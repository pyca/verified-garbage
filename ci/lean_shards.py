"""Plans how CI splits the Lean build across runners.

CI restores the last build `main` saved, and Lake rebuilds only the modules
whose sources changed since, and the modules importing them. The build is
limited mostly by throughput, so the modules to rebuild are split into
shards that build in parallel on separate runners, as many as the work
needs: none when one would do (the `lean` job builds it), up to `MAX_SHARDS`
when everything changed.

`main` saves a manifest next to its build: the hash of every module's source,
of the build's inputs, and how long each module took to build (from the shards' build logs, kept
from earlier builds for the modules this one did not rebuild). A plan
compares the sources with the manifest's to find the modules to rebuild,
estimates each from its time, and packs them into shards: a shard builds the
modules that nothing imports ("sinks") it is given, and so everything they
import. A shard's build takes at least its modules' time divided by the
number a runner builds at once, and at least its longest chain of imports
(the "critical path": a module waits for those it imports), so its time is
estimated as the larger of the two. The sinks are packed by the time to
rebuild their imports, largest first, each into the shard where the estimate
it leaves, plus the work it adds there (as time on a runner), is the least:
a shard with a long chain takes other work only until it would finish after
the chain, and a sink goes where much of what it imports is built already,
rather than building it again elsewhere, unless that shard is the slower by
more than the work it saves. A change to the inputs (the toolchain, the
dependencies or the lakefile's settings) rebuilds every module, but not one
that only adds a module to a library or removes one (the lakefile's `globs`
and `roots`): that rebuilds just the modules it moves (and, through their
imports, what imports them). Every module is in exactly one shard (the first
that builds it), so the shards' outputs together are the whole build. A plan
is only an estimate: whatever the shards leave unbuilt, the job that
assembles their outputs (the last shard to finish, normally) builds.
